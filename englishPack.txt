"It's been ten years since I was adopted by the masters. I have grown, but my masters are getting old."
"While the masters have raised me with strength of body and helped me cultivate my chakras, they would not teach me how to fight."
"But I knew there were plans afoot all that time. The village at the base of our mountain had become a staging ground for General Brazen's old troops. To an outsider they were just villagers, but I knew what they really were."
"Every one of them strong enough to beat ten men. Like my father, they followed the General when he was alive. And they had vowed to avenge him."
"Now, the time has come for me to join them."
"This is Hidden Village."
"The villagers are General Brazen's veterans and their descendants."
"Every one of them a match for ten other men."
"The Four Masters want me to learn some skills from the village elders."
"I will grow strong enough to avenge my family."
"Let it all begin here."

"Give me a second to think on it."
"No wonder the master likes you. You are a smart one, aren't you? But not half as smart as I am, haha."
"Sure."
"Do not mess with me! My dad will get you!"
"To save a life, one must be taken. This is the natural order."
"%s, you are here. Gregg says you offended him when he went to welcome you. Is this true?"
"I only responded to his words in kind. He was looking for a fight."
"Just as I thought. Gregg is a good kid, just very narrow-minded. A pity...Do you have something on your mind?"
"Yes, sir. There are two people seeking your help outside. One of them looks badly injured..."
"Leave it. It's not your business to mind. The Four Masters brought you up well. I see great potential in you. Go pick a weapon at the blacksmith's and show me what you can do."
"[Sal is an eccentric man. I will do as he says for now. Perhaps later I can find a way to persuade him.] Yes, sir."
"That is all you can do? What a waste. The Four masters gave you the makings of a great warrior, but you have no skills. It seems we'll have to start from the beginning."
"[Yang Hu was right!]  But sir...What about the outsiders at the gate?"
"I told you it's none of your business. To save a life, another needs to be taken. They don't really want my help, or else they would have killed someone already, instead of crying outside."
"But...but what if they don't want to sacrifice someone else's life to save their own?"
"Well, not my problem then, is it? I am not one to mess with nature. Stop bothering me about it and focus on learning your skills! Take this skill book and go do some reading."
"[He won't budge. What do I do?] Ok. Thank you sir."
"Not bad. Keep it up. The Four Masters trust Warren and I to train you. We won't let them down. As for you, you'd better practice hard."
"Thank you, sir. Of course, I will, sir. But sir...What about the outsiders?"
"Seriously? You don't let up, do you? Ok, fine! I will maybe consider helping them, if you do something for me first. Maybe."
"Really? What is it?"
"There is a gang of bullies on the east side of the village. They've been causing a lot of unneeded trouble recently. Go sort them out for me."
"Yes, sir."
"There are bullies in Hidden Village? What nerve!"
"What are you waiting for? Need me to give you a kick start?"
"Aricia? What? Aren't those the outsiders?"
"I was only a small child when General Brazen passed away and we retreated here. Now I am an old man."
"I know you are close with Aricia. You think she is a survivor of the southern massacre, like yourself? Truth be told, The Four Masters, Sal and I are all suspicious of her story. You must have noticed how we try to keep you away from her."
"No! You are wrong! Sal examined her wounds himself, the day she came here!"
"I know you don't want to believe us. But I also know you are too kind and innocent to see the darker side of people. It's fine if you don't believe us now. But please be careful around her."
"Elder, I don't...I..."
"It's ok. You need time to think on this. We don't have hard proof against her yet. For now go see how Tesia is doing and try to clear your head."
"...ok."
"Bern couldn't have picked a worse time to be so reckless!"
"Elder, Bern left in a rage, I am worried about him. Let's go bring him back before he does anything foolish."
"No! That idiot! Tesia lies gravely injured and all he can think of is revenge! I refuse to acknowledge such a son!"
"Elder, Bern is obviously not thinking clearly. He is acting out of grief and anger."
"You don't need to defend him. He probably read the letter, learned the Jurchens intend to station themselves at the Green Hill to cut our supplies, and then got worked up about it."
"Elder, could I go to Green Hill and bring him back?"
"Bern is not here. And didn't Warren say the Jurchen would station here? But there are not a lot of them here..."
"Ok. Green Hill is far. Let me help you get there. "
"Anything you say, we will follow, Elder! We won't let those Jurchens bully us!"
"Hidden Village's fate depends on this one battle. You are our hope! Yang Hu, %s is alone in Green Hill. Go help! "
"Right away, Elder!"
"I am the descendent of generations of blacksmiths...Whatever you desire, give me a piece of good steel and you will have it."
"%s, aren't you supposed to be training with Warren and Sal? What are you doing here?"
"Sal wants me to pick a weapon."
"Ah, I see. I've just made four weapons based upon the ones your Four Masters carry. Take your pick."
"Thank you very much! [But which one should I pick...]"
"Seriously? Quite indecisive, aren't you...Better give up now, kid. Skills won't do you any good, will they?"
"I won't quit!"
"Good. Just don't be one of those kids that only talk the talk."
"[He is so mean.] Stop making fun of me already."
"Alright. Didn't Sal want you to show him what you've got? There is a training post over there. Go try out your weapon on it."
"Alright then."
"My husband is not home. You should come back when he is back."
"Today's was a good hunt. Now I can go sell these furs in River Town and buy some gifts for Tesia."
"Hey, what brings you to Sunset Hill today?"
"Bern! The two outsiders from the gate took Aricia!"
"No doubt associated with the Outsiders at Green Hill!"
"I don't know. I just know that they were here seeking Sal's help. Now they have taken Aricia and threaten to kill her so Sal will help them!"
"What? Tell me the whole story. Don't leave out a single detail. I think they might be connected with the outsiders gathering at Green Hill. They seem to be waiting for something up there."
"[You tell Bern the whole story.] Do you really think they are connected?"
"Might be. If so, they probably weren't seeking healing, but information on the village. We didn't let them in, so now they have taken Aricia to force information out of her."
"No! I have to go save her!"
"Please help my husband get better, please..."
"%s? What are you doing here? The wolves in the woods did not hurt you, did they?"
"Those wolves are no match for me, madam. I brought more medicine for Lisle. How is he?"
"Same as always. Sal is so good to help supress his symptoms. But I fear it may one day be too much for him and he will bring grief to us all."
"He will get better, I am sure."
"Thank you. At least I still have my sons, Connan and Cal. If only he would get better, then we could be a happy family again. But, anyway, it's getting late. You probably should get back to the village."
"Take care."
"Isn't that man hurt? How could they run so fast? What is that in the bush?"
"Aricia's bracelet. She left clues! I'll get Bern!"
"I am not crazy. You are crazy. All of you are crazy!"
"This is Sparrow Village. You will be safe here."
"Fresh...por...pork. Chea...Cheap."
"Hidden Village is such a nice, peaceful place."
"%s, finally!"
"%s, come on! Sal is waiting for you in the village."
"Aricia? You've been waiting?"
"Yes. Your Four Masters told Warren and Sal you were coming today. I got here first, so that makes me your senior, haha."
"My senior? Ha. Let's see what you've got then!"
"Pay attention. First you need to train your strength, resilience, stamina and agility. They can help boost your attack, defense, health points and dexterity. If you balance these things well, you will do great."
"Wow. You memorized it perfectly!"
"Hey, don't talk like that to your senior!"
"Ok. Ok. Let's go see Warren and Sal."
"No. You need to follow my lead. Let's go to see Warren and Sal."
"Haha. Really. I am so happy that you will stay here in the village now."
"Now you won't get in trouble with The Four Masters for sneaking down the hill to see me anymore. "
"Looks like that Gregg is giving someone a hard time again."
"%s, how long have you been here? Sneaking up on me like that, you scared me half to death!"
"I just got here. Aricia, why were you with the outsiders? And wasn't that Tesia?"
"Oh, they decided that it's useless waiting here and wanted to know if there are any other healers nearby. But how would I know, right? As for Tesia...I promised I would visit her today."
"But why did she leave then?"
"Because, because I have something I have to do first. Sal made more medicine for Lisle and he wants me to bring it to him immediately."
"But to get there you need to go through the woods. And aren't there wolves there? You can't do that on your own!"
"I know!  And Tesia was going to teach me to knit today too! %s, do you think perhaps you can go for me? I promise to be nice to you for a whole week! "
"Ok then. Give me the medicine. Let me dance with the wolves."
"What do they want?"
"%s, how could you be so reckless! You don't know who they are or if they have anything to do with Aricia's disappearance. Even if they did, did you plan to save her all alone? You want them to get you too?"
"Bern, I am sorry. But I am so worried about Aricia. What should we do now?"
"Well, what's done is done. We will  just have to cut to the chase and confront them about Aricia."
"Ok. And how are we going to do that?"
"You don't need to come. You are a rookie."
"No! Bern, it's Aricia! I have to go. If you don't take me. I will go on my own."
"Ok. Ok! But you stay behind me at all times, alright? If anything happens, run back to the village as fast as you can and get help!"
"Ok. I got it."
"Try not to make a sound. Let's hide behind that tent."
"You won't get away! What are they talking about?"
"%s, calm down! We don't know whether it's true and what it all means yet."
"But Bern! They took Aricia! If we let them get away, then we'll never find Aricia!"
"I knew you wouldn't listen! That old man won't be able to get away with Aricia on his own. Let's find a way to confront them."
"OK! I really should have thought of that. Let's do it!"
"Stop, %s! Come back here!"
"Tesia! It's all my fault."
"Why did you come to Hidden Village? And why did you take Aricia?"
"Hahaha. I won't tell. You are gonna die here, that's all you need to know."
"Tesia! Tesia! Wake up!"
"Ah! What happened? Why is Tesia covered in blood?"
"It's all my fault. Tesia is Jurchen. This bastard tried to turn me against her. And..and he did. I doubted my wife. She shielded me from his attack..."
"What? ... Aricia? Is Aricia here?"
"Aricia is not here. Tesia keeps saying Aricia, Acclia something like that. But I don't know what she means. You should search the camp, maybe you can find something."
"Ok."
"%s, it's a trap! Let's go!"
"That letter was planted. Saxon led the Jurchens arcoss Reed Field and ambushed us. Warren and the others are fighting them now. He asked me to get you to safety."
"No. I will stay! I won't desert you."
"Don't be so willful! Think about your family's revenge! You are Hidden Village's last hope. If you die here, it will all be for nothing!"
"Last hope? Sal, what do you mean?"
"There is much you do not know! Hurry! Don't let your family's sacrifice be in vain!"
"I will dishonor my family if I leave!"
"Stubborn as a bull. Fine, then. Come with me. We'll see what Warren says. Hurry! "
"OK. Let's go!"
"No one can fight against fate. Perhaps my time in Hidden Village is done."
"%s, how did Tesia get hurt? Tell me."
"Elder, it's because... [You tell Warren the whole story]"
"Tesia is Jurchen? Well, so what? Bern is a fool. They've been married for three years, if she wanted to do us harm, we wouldn't still be breathing. Did you find anything in the camp?"
"I only found this half burned letter near the fire ash."
"Hmm. Read it to me."
"Yes, Elder."
"Wipe out the village? We are General Brazen's Troops! Let them come!"
"Elder, what volume are they talking about?"
"Must be the one General Brazen wrote in prison on battle techniques. %s, these might be the people that massacred the five southern lords. They have found us. The storm is coming..."
"No wonder they knew about me. But Elder, if they really are those people, then wouldn't Aricia be..."
"I know about Aricia's abduction. %s, too much has happened today. Let's go back to the village and prepare for battle. Then I will tell you about Aricia."
"But, but she...yes, Elder, I understand."
"%s, their being here may not entirely be a bad thing. This means the half of the volume your family was safekeeping is not yet in their hands."
"But nobody knows where either of the halves are. And General Brazen's brother has no power in court..."
"That's why we hoped to train you here. %s, we want you to find the volume. But the Jurchens came too soon..."
"Elder, don't worry. I will find it."
"Take this letter Sal has written to the Lakeside Chief, August. When you get to River Town, find him and show him the letter. He will take care of you. He is an old friend of Sal's."
"OK. %s won't disappoint you, Elder!"
"Train hard once you get to the village!"
"If you don't behave, I will go down there and beat some sense into you!"
"You are on your own now. Take care of yourself."
"%s, be good. Oh, I miss the days when you were just learning to walk..."
"%s, finally!"
"I warned you not to stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Sal won't save anyone unless another life is taken. Don't start acting like you are the boss, just because you were raised by The Four Masters."
"Gregg, how can you talk like that? All life is precious."
"Enough with your hypocrisy!"
"Gregg, have you no honor?"
"Oh, sorry. We didn't all have four respectable masters to teach us manners."
"Gregg, stop this nonsense."
"%s, you just wait and see. One day you'll get what's coming to you."
"Not before you do!"
"%s, they look so pitiful. Why don't you go ask Sal to help them? I will stay here and wait for you."
"No need to give anyone a hard time."
"I've never seen you before. Sorry, I have to ask. What is your business here at River Town?"
"I am trying to find someone. Do you know where August, the Lakeside Chief is?"
"You came for August? Well, he is a good friend of the Mayor's. He is in the town plaza that way."
"Thank you for your help."
"A real man defends not only his family, but also his realm."
"What do you need me for then?"
"I have a letter here."
"[After reading the letter.] You are heir to the lands of the southern lords! Of course I will help you find out the truth about what happened. But it will take time."
"I understand. But another survivor was just captured by the Jurchens. I was thinking maybe you can help me save her?"
"Of course! Just tell me what she looks like. I will do my best to find her."
"Thank you, August! Her name is Aricia... [You describe Aricia to August.]"
"Ok. I will let you know as soon as I find something. Meanwhile, can you help me check the army supplies on this list?"
"Of course!"
"%s, you look troubled. Trouble with the supplies?"
"No. But there is something else... [Tell him about Alexander's son.]"
"[Thinking] The Jurchens are being beat by the Mongols. They have no supplies. That's why they raid ours. His disappearance probably has something to do with that too. I will help find him."
"The Jurchens? I will help too!"
"My father is out in the City Limits helping the army. Maybe he knows something. Let me write to him and ask. Then we can decide what to do."
"The Jurchens outside might have Aricia. I need to go and check."
"Ok. %s, let me first write to the Mayor for help. You can bring the letter to him and go meet my father after."
"Ok."
"My father said you wounded Damien and stole the Bow Designs for us! Well done! You do your father proud!!"
"Thanks."
"My friend Koen and his wife Ramona live on Floret Island. Koen has mentioned you a couple of times. Would you like to go meet him on the island?"
"You mean, Koen, master Koen?"
"Yes. He met your father a few times. Now he knows you are here. He wants to meet you and discuss an important matter. He wouldn't disclose its nature though."
"Ugh...I have no idea what it would be about either."
"I guess you will find out soon. Floret Island is not kind to strangers. You will need a map. Ramona drew one for my wife, Shandra once. You can borrow it."
"Ok. I will go find her."
"To learn and master skills, you must never stop practicing. Just keep working on it, and you will become a great warrior."
"I know. I have always prefered practicing with others though."
"Good. River Town is just the place for that. Go practice in the plaza. I am sure you will find several people willing to train with you there."
"Ok then."
"So did you learn something?"
"When I focus, I can feel this strength pulsing through me."
"Can you give me a hint?"
"I'd like to hear your thoughts."
"You are made for greatness. I believe you've learned what you need to know already."
"Thank you, August."
"Thank goodness you are here! The Mongols are working with the Jurchens practicing hard to strike us at River Town!"
"The Mongols wiped the Jurchens out. And the Jurchens would side with them?"
"When they have the same agenda obviously! They want River Town. And we don't have the power to fight them both!"
"What's our best strategy? "
"We don't have enough soldiers or supplies to start a battle. But swordsmen like us could sneak in, attack and weaken them. What do you think?"
"Count me in!"
"All I have. All I am. I owe it to my people."
"I hear August sent you."
"Yes, sir. I have a letter from him."
"Ok. I will make time to go see him soon."
"Thank you, sir. I am going to go see Randall now."
"Randall is in the City Limits with the army. I can write you an introduction to take with you."
"Thank you, sir."
"In times like these one needs to make friends. River Town needs a talent like you. So of course I will help as I can."
"Thank you sir. I will take care to make friends too."
"I have a way to help you make friends with just the right people."
"Please tell me."
"Really? I really want to know."
"This way you can make friends faster."
"Thank you, sir."
"%s, I have something urgent to ask you."
"What is it, sir?"
"General Wade is trapped outside. I can't really send the city guards to help and leave River Town unprotected. You are our only hope."
"Of course, I will help! Where is he now?"
"Ok. I will go find her."
"This is outrageous! Simply outrageous!"
"What's the matter, Mayor?"
"After you attacked the Enemy Camp, the Mongols and the Jurchens recruited the Creed of Five and Lotus Creed followers to surround the City Limits!"
"What! City Limits is the gate to River Town. This needs to be dealt with now!"
"I plan to lead the troops myself to battle with them! Would you like to join me?"
"I am much honored to!"
"Thank you for your service!"
"I am yours to command, Mayor. "
"A good warrior must have a good weapon. Hey, I mean you."
"You look like a promising young hero. What a pity you don't have a nice piece of weaponry worthy of your station. Come, come, I will get you one."
"No, thank you. This was a gift from my elders."
"Oh. If you are not here to buy weapons, what are you here for?"
"August sent me to check the army supplies."
"Ok. I sent the weapons to refine at Smith's. They should be ready by now. I can't really step out here. Could you go check it for me?"
"Sure. I will go to Smith's."
"When are you coming back from the war...What can I help you with?"
"You are not from here, are you?"
"No. I am new in town. August sent me to check on the supplies."
"Good. We've prepared 5000 bags of clothes, cotton and blankets for the soldiers. They are ready to go."
"Thank you, madam!"
"No need. If not for the soldiers, I wouldn't be standing here. Whatever August and the soldiers need, I am ready to give."
"Well said. I need to check on the other supplies now. Farewell."
"Wait, your clothes...Tell you what, go get 15 Alligator Skins and 30 Monkey Claws and bring them to Solomon and I will get you something proper to wear."
"Ok. Thank you."
"A good weapon can mean life and death."
"Oh, watch out! Don't let the liquid get to you!"
"Thank you."
"Balint sent you right? I am almost finished with the weapon supplies. What is that you are holding? Honestly, it could use some refining too."
"Could you help me then?"
"Well, I can teach you how. Follow my instructions."
"Ok, thank you."
"Smart kid. Yes, just keep doing it like this."
"Thank you, Smith."
"Ah. I've already finished. The rest of the weapons are in the Warehouse. I think they just moved the last supply a few days ago."
"Ok. I will go check."
"Yeah. It's over that way."
"Ok. See you."
"It's you again! Congratulations for the limits triumph!"
"Thank you, Smith. Can I have my gear refined?"
"Thank you, Smith."
"A good piece of gear needs to be refined from time to time to keep that edge."
"I got it."
"Do you have something on your mind? You have a bright future ahead of you. Hold on to it."
"Ok. I am leaving River Town, Smith. Farewell."
"War is coming. And I haven't even got a wife yet!"
"Lonely heart. Lonely heart."
"What are you doing?"
"I was just thinking wouldn't it be nice if you had someone to travel the realm with you, to love you, talk to you, fight with you and keep you company? Wouldn't that be nice?"
"Of course it would be nice. But love doesn't just happen you know."
"But one does need to put oneself out there to meet that someone special, right? You know you can publish an ad in your friends interface under Social."
"Oh, really? Thank you."
"That Gambit Frantic sets up very challenging games."
"Want to go try a match with him?"
"Not really. Didn't they say no one could rival him?"
"Until he is rivaled, that is. Come on, you have nothing to lose. If you win, you win. If you lose, at least you've practiced with one of the best."
"Good point. Maybe I should give it a try then."
"Knowledge, it is in the books."
"Umm, Sir, why are you giving me all these gifts?"
"They are not yours yet. Pass me a few tests and they will be. How about that?"
"That's perfect. Please."
"Nice! Please just wait a second."
"Thank you, Sir. I've learned a lot."
"Second test. We are winning the war. But your help at the battle field would still be favored."
"Umm, what is it you want to do?"
"Righto!"
"Thank you, Sir!"
"This is too sophisticated. I fear I won't be able to master it."
"Thank you. You are so thoughtful!"
"What do you think of the island?"
"The island is such a beautiful, yet dangerous place. It fits Eastern Heretic's name."
"Speaking of dangerous. Poisonous Scorpions have somehow found their way to the island. One bite from them could take one adult's life."
"That is dangerous. Sir, you are thinking..."
"Let me take care of it."
"Were you a realm traveler once?"
"Thanks. [These all all sought after books. And he would simply give them away like this. What a character!]"
"Then please wait awhile for me."
"This book teaches you how to move faster."
"Oh?"
"Once you've mastered it, you can soar into the sky and walk on water."
"That powerful?"
"[How much knowledge he has hidden under the surface, I wonder.] Thanks."
"The last test is to defeat the Servant Leader. Remember even Theron took some trouble to tame him."
"I will."
"[What? He modified the skill? What talent! But is that entirely honorable to modify other people's skills and teach it?]"
"You are thinking this is not honorable, aren't you?"
"Uh... Yes. I am."
"In my understanding, learning is about getting the good and eliminating the bad. This skill has a dark origin. What I did is to remove the evil factor. I think that is up your ally."
"I understand now. Thank you, Sir!"
"Be careful in the cave!"
"Complete Presents (6) to enter Toad Cave here"
"%s, how have you been? Your power has grown!"
"Thank you. "
"Good, good. You look a different person, you know. I can see how much powerful you've become."
"I have you to thank for that."
"Element Grounds follows the element ring effect. Learn to work with a special element zone to boost your vita."
"Yes. I have. Is there a way to help with that?"
"Elementalist manages the Element Grounds. Shandra knows him well. She can introduce you."
"Ok. I will go there now!"
"Our Warehouse, your safe house."
"Ah! What now! My family's reputation! My family's business! Ah! How am I gonna face my ancestors!"
"What's the matter?"
"No. No. It's ok. It's just.... we are closed for the day. Please come back tomorrow?"
"I am not here to store cargo. August sent me to check on the supplies."
"Our last shipment should have arrived already. My son is something of a warrior and friends with the general. So he went with the Royal Cavalier to escort it."
"But?"
"But I lost contact with my son. He is missing. Now the second shipment is ready to go. What if, what if he is not coming back? Ah!"
"Don't worry. I will inform August of this. He will help."
"Come, come. I offer the fairest price for the best pieces!"
"Whatever you are looking for, I have just the mount for you!"
"Hush! haha! This one is a bit naughty. haha"
"Ugh, hi..."
"Hey! You looking for a mount? You're in the right place!"
"Uh. I can't really afford one. I was actually sent here by August to check the supplies."
"Oh, ok. You can tell him that I have already prepared three hundred horses ready to move on his orders."
"Okay!"
"Don't leave so fast, ay? Any friend of August is a friend of mine - maybe I could help provide you with a mount free of charge? It won't be one of my best, but it will get you where you want to go every time."
"Really?"
"Yeah. Of course. As I said, any friend of August is a friend of mine."
"Thank you!"
"Just remember, treat your mount like you would a person. If treat it right, it will love you, help you and protect you."
"How should I treat it then?"
"Ok. Let me try."
"Ah? What do you think? Better? Once it reaches Stage 3, its looks will change too. Don't be shocked when it happens!"
"I look forward to that!"
"Medicine. For you and your family."
"So what is wrong with you?"
"Oh, no. Nothing is wrong with me. August sent me to check the supplies."
"Oh. I have my supplies ready to move on August's order."
"Great!"
"You must be new here. Fancy any medicine? You should really take some with you, being a fighter and all."
"It's ok. I will have a look here and then I am off to the Garment Shop."
"Even the best gems still need carving to be perfect."
"Every whisper we hear. Every thought we see."
"Jurchen is no longer a country. But there are still some stray Jurchen soldiers wandering around the town. Also, after your fight, Damien died of injury."
"He died? Are you absolutely sure?"
"When has the Inn ever been not sure?"
"Uh, I see..."
"Damien is dead, but his successor Beldon is even worse than he was. He's declared himself king of the City Limits."
"It just doesn't seem possible..."
"Yeah? How about a young hero venturing into the heart of the enemy to take down their chief? How's that for impossible?"
"What are you driving at?"
"Do you not want to be that hero?"
"I am thinking..."
"You what? Go already."
"Good point. Ok. Why not?"
"Did you slay Beldon then?"
"Of course I did!"
"Well done. Here, take these."
"Thank you."
"Back in the years, there were the Southern Lords and Seven Stars in the South. Now the Southern Lords have all fallen and the Seven Stars only have The Bat Blind Master left on the Floret Island."
"So, the South has lost its glory."
"You could say that. But that's just the way things go. The best will be replaced by more of the best."
"And why are you bringing this up?"
"Actually I mean to introduce you to Blind Master. You can practice with him, which I think is quite an opportunity for you."
"Really? Thank you, Ezra!"
"How was the fight?"
"Brilliant! Blind Master is a great teacher! Thank you."
"I heard you met Eastern Heretic Theron? "
"True. I met the Island Master, Theron, in the Veiled Brook. A rather ecccentric man."
"An eccentric certainly. But at the same time you'll never meet a more old fashioned romantic in the whole realm. Never loved another woman but his wife. Never married after she passed."
"Sounds like quite a character."
"It's been a while since you practiced with Blind Master. Do you want to practice with another great warrior?"
"Really? You want to introduce me to someone new?"
"Sure, Theron, the Island Master. I hear he is around Brook Lair these days."
"Great. I will go now."
"You must have learned a lot from this fight too. Digest it and use it."
"I will."
"Master Sem was once the King of Dali. But when Ance murdered his wife's bastard son, sired by Frey, he chose to reserve his power and did not save him. He regretted that decision terribly, eventually giving up everything to join the faith."
"Frey and the queen shouldn't have had an affair either."
"Who knows. What bothered him is that he didn't save an innocent life."
"How is he now?"
"The temple life has done Master Sem wonders. His power has been refined. Why not go challenge him? He will be more than happy to teach you a thing or two."
"He found his answers in the faith. I haven't seen him for a while, actually. Maybe you should go visit him for me."
"Among the five Grandmasters, Western Venom Soren has the most tragic past. Taoist Master Cyrus suppressed him. When he was gone, Ramona tricked him and made him lose his minds."
"But he worked with the Jurchen to harm the realm. Ramona did not step out of the line."
"But even then he managed to create a powerful set of skills. They may be peculiar but they are very destructive."
"All the Five Grandmasters earned their fame with true talent. The shame is Soren fell to the wrong side. "
"So you would like to go to Crest Lair and challenge Soren then?"
"Hmm, I would like to go try. "
"The Taoist Master was quite a figure. He fought to defend the country, but alas his power alone was not enough to turn the tide. If not for Athena, he would never have left the Immortals Tomb again. "
"Even the Taoist Master faced difficult times."
"Of course. Behind every great man or woman, there is a heart-wrenching story. "
"Later he single-handedly founded the Taoist School. The wisdom and strength it takes to do such a thing are unimaginable. "
"Alas he has long passed. But if you want to learn some Taoist Kungfu, you can try your hand against his first apprentice, Logon. What do you think?"
"I will most definitely go to the Hermit Peaks for it!"
"You've fought all the Five Grandmasters, but for the Old Beggar. He is a hard man to find. Even we can't figure out his whereabouts most of the time. "
"I have a feeling this is not one of those times. "
"Ha, smart! Yes, we just spotted him in Forest Lair. Hurry there and he might teach you a thing or two!"
"I am on my way!"
"Do you know Master Uncontested?"
"Yes, of course! Albelt got his sword from him. "
"Yes, he did. Do you know what he is known for though? His skill-The Lonely Nine. He could fight without a sword in hand without a move in mind just with that. "
"How is that even possible?"
"That's why he was a master, ha. His disciple, Wind learned the skill from him. I know he is at Mount Lair. Why don't you go try your hand with him and see what it's like?"
"I will do so then. "
"The Monastery helped build the Tang Dynasty and has held a firm superior position in the swordsman world ever since. Each monk is a master on his own. "
"True. "
"The Monastery is famed to be just and fair. "
"That's a hard rule to follow these days. "
"They also do welcome a challenge from now and then. The first seat at Arhat Hall, Master Chastiser is a worthy opponent. "
"I shall go challenge him then. "
"%s, I've been waiting for you."
"You knew I was coming?"
"I have the answers you are looking for. Of course you would come."
"Let's cut to the chase then. What happened to Carla?"
"Carla followed the wrong path. She should have been put to death. But I watched her grow up. I couldn't. So I sent her to a friend in the faith. Hopefully she will repent of her sins in the temple."
"That may be the best thing for her. Could you tell me the whole story about my family now?"
"Whole story? Kid, nobody knows the whole story, even The Inn. All I can tell you is what the world saw happen. But the beginning and the ending are not mine to tell."
"After that you should know."
"Aricia lied to me even as she was dying, still trying to cover for the Occult..."
"She's been gone for a long time now. You should let her go. She did love you. But she loved Jurchen more."
"I know. I understand. In my heart, the realm weighs heavier than her too."
"Thank you for telling me all this. I will be fine."
"Hey, hey! Come look! An ant hole!"
"Mom said you saved Uncle Alan and Sanders? I don't believe it! You don't look that scary!"
"Well, it's up to you whether you believe it or not. [I am not going to argue with a little child.]"
"No! You have to make me believe! "
"You're bossy, aren't you?"
"I'll make a bet with you. If you can get a streak of 100 and get the Glower effect, I will believe you. If you don't take the bet, you are obviously scared, ha."
"Well, it doesn't take a lot of time anyway."
"Umm. Maybe mom was right then."
"Whatever."
"Hey, I said maybe. I did say she was definitely right."
"I don't care, okay?"
"Oh, look who is being rude to a little child!"
"I am being rude?"
"Yeah, you are. I will bet with you again. If you make a streak of 200 and get the Iron Blood effect. I will not doubt you again!"
"Alright then."
"Really? You really did it? How do you feel now?"
"Nothing much. I am just tired."
"Now I am sure you are the one that saved Uncle Alan and Sanders. So how did you get so powerful? Any tricks you want to share?"
"Who taught you talk like this?"
"None of your business. Now I am bored. Why don't you go and get a streak of 300?"
"300? Well, why not."
"Wow! You did it! I love you so much, only a little bit less than uncle Alan and Sanders!"
"Haha. Wait till you meet the real masters."
"Master? Would you be my master, please?"
"Wait, what? How old are you?"
"Doesn't matter! I just want to be your pupil!"
"Ugh. Can I not want to be your master then?"
"[Tears welling up] Really? You would be that cruel to a little child?"
"Um..."
"Fine! If you can get a streak of 400, then I will consider leaving you alone."
"God, why are you punishing me?"
"But now I want you to be my master more! Master!"
"Listen, kiddo. I really don't have the time, okay?"
"Wuuu! You are so mean! How do you treat a cute little baby like this!"
"Why are you treating me like this!"
"I don't care. Now you have to go and get me a streak of 500 and the Brave Heart effect!"
"When can this be over!"
"Master! You are so great!"
"Ugh, I really don't want a pupil!"
"Your mind is set then. I can't begin to tell you how sad I am right now."
"You mom really shouldn't bring you to watch this kind of thing anyway."
"Really? You don't want to be my master, but you want to mess with my personal life? No!"
"Oh my!"
"Your what? I want a streak of 600 and the True Knight effect. You better go get it, before I cry."
"God, please help me!"
"You are so great! I admire you so much, I want to tell you a secret."
"It's ok. You can keep your secret."
"Alright. Since you want to know so much, I will tell you then."
"Ugh, I don't want to know."
"They say if one can achieve a streak of 700, one can summon a great big dragon that will grant one a wish."
"Do you think I was born yesterday?"
"[Looking very serious] I guess it's time for me to reveal my true identity"
"It's ok. You can stay as you are."
"Ah!! You are so mean! I just want you to get a streak of 700! I just want that! Can't you go already!"
"Ah...Ok!"
"Once there was a great warrior who wanted to take me as a pupil. But I was so young and so busy with having a life, I said No. If I could be given one more chance, I would..."
"Ugh, Addy, your mom is calling you to go home for dinner."
"Streak, streak! Get a streak!"
"Roaming you are, in the lands of monsters; stealing your gear is what I will be doing."
"Streak, streak! Go, go streak!"
"Roaming you are, in the lands of monsters; stealing your skill books is what I will be doing."
"Addy? Where is that child off too this time!"
"Addy...Addy!"
"Where did that kid go this time!"
"Life is short. Enjoy what you have."

"%s, could I present you a little something for your valor?"
"Thank you. That's so nice!"
"Are you a reliable person?"
"What? I have to wait more?"
"Oh, really? I can escort the cargo with a lady then? Ok, then I will come back on 23rd, October for it. "
"You must be brave to travel the realm. So many dark places that could swallow you whole. But if you survive them, you will grow even stronger."
"Hi. My husband told me about you. Just a second. Let me go get the Island Map for you."
"Thank you, madam."
"Here. Follow this map, you should be able to get on the island fine. When you see Koen, please ask him and Ramona to come for the Realm Summit as soon as possible."
"I will. Farewell, madam."
"Wait. The island is not a common place. You might want to refine your armor first."
"Ok. Thank you."
"Troubles in the world..."
"Thank you for all you've done for me."
"It's my pleasure."
"I see there are many warriors here in town. There are Mongols wandering outside too. Are you sure we won't get you into trouble?"
"The Inn is not just any place. Trust me, you will be safe here."
"Ok. then. I really need to go make some arrangements for my people now. Could you excuse me for a second?"
"Of course. Of course. I will go visit the owner."
"%s, you are back. I need to tell you something."
"Oh?"
"In the desert, I couldn't help you and the others. To this day, I still feel guilty about it."
"I should have done better too..."
"I led my people here to join the local Lotus Creed, and keep them safe. I should offer my service to the Creed by helping to retrieve the Lotus Sigil."
"You mean to join the search."
"Yes. Thank you for everything. If not for you we wouldn't have made it this far."
"You helped me a lot too."
"I was lost when I found you. But you gave me a purpose."
"Sir, please, please take pity on me and give me some food..."
"You are all busy following your dreams. You don't even spare me a look. But you don't know it's your loss."
"You are an interesting fellow."
"I am not just interesting."
"Oh?"
"Old fellow here has seen the world, has cried every tear and laughed every laugh. You want fame and power? Just give me one Gold, and I will trade you a skill book page. Deal?"
"Well, what's the harm."
"Are you sure?"
"Yeah. Here one Gold."
"Ummm, let me think on it."
"Good! Wait, let me grab my bag."
"Thank you."
"When a window shuts, a door opens. Come back tomorrow."
"Ok. Tomorrow."
"We beg for your patience."
"Well. Let's see how you do tomorrow."
"We beg for your patience. We are doing our best to give you a good time."
"Get out of here."
"No. I will not be patient."
"Ok. Keep up the good work!"
"If you could be more patient, we will give you a present...[Pussy-in-boot eyes]"
"Present? Alright then."
"Thank you! We will continue to do our best for you!"
"Hurry and go fix a bug already!"
"Sorry if we haven't fixed all the bugs yet."
"Sorry if the game doesn't always run as fast as you wish."
"Sorry if we haven't got more interesting systems yet. But we are working on it!"
"Eh?[Richmond looks up at you for a second, makes a noise and turns his back at you.] "
"It is just too hot today! So much to help the Mayor do everyday! So tired..."
"When this craziness is over, I must find a nice place to relax with some quality company, ha."
"Yes, of course!"
"Soldiers! Follow me!"
"%s, long time no see."
"Yeah. It's been a while."
"I see you've grown quite a lot. Would you like to come to our Training Hall and practice with us?"
"Really? You would let me do that!"
"Of course! I will go!"
"%s, we've seen some odd behavior among the Mongols. They seem to be attempting to sabotage the treaty and invade us. They've been transporting large amounts of cargo towards River Town."
"How will you counter them?"
"Yes we do! It's just we need more warriors like you to intercept their supplies."
"Ok. Just tell me where."
"Sure. If you go see Shandra, you might be able to meet other warriors to go with!"
"Ok. I will head over now."
"Master always taught us to be men of honor. We don't need to obey society's rules, but we stand up for what's right."
"Good. I am Theron's fourth apprentice, Randall. I am helping the army fight the Jurchens."
"I am %s. It's great to see you in person!"
"Haha. It's great to know there are still young heroes like yourself! %s, you say? Did you come from River Town?"
"Yes. I came to the limits to see you, Sir."
"Haha! I've been waiting for you! August told me about you. I've had my men search for Aricia. We found something yesterday."
"Really? Thank you! Where is she?"
"Before I tell you that and you rush to go save her, I think you should learn some new skills. You will need them. Would you like to learn how to move faster?"
"Of course, Sir!"
"Well done. Now it's up to you to practice that skill in battle."
"Thank you, Sir. Now could you tell me where Aricia is?"
"Actually, all we know is that there is a mysterious young lady in the Jurchen camp. She has her own tent. And it doesn't look like she is under supervision, but rather under extra protection..."
"Umm...[They must be trying to lure her into talking about the Volume of War.]"
"[Studying your face] Anyhow, we should at least go confirm whether or not that's her. %s, go set a fire in the Jurchen camp to cause chaos. Someone there will come to help you."
"Ok."
"Why not try your new skill? Press Space!"
"Urgent and important intelligence!"
"This is the time we need our warriors the most! Help defeat the invaders!"
"Just tell me where!"
"You have a promising future ahead!"
"Thank you."
"Our soldiers are wounded. We need more supplies!"
"The Jurchens are losing the war. But as everyone knows: a caged dog bites all the harder. Too many of our soldiers are wounded. And the supplies are not coming in time."
"Anything I can do to help?"
"Thank you. Bodies of soldiers Jurchen or Song lie all over the river bank in the limits. The sun is hot. When they putrefy, I fear they might contaminate the town's water supply."
"Indeed. How should we handle it then?"
"The best way might be to burn the bodies. What do you think?"
"I agree."
"Let me then. Let me give the soldiers a proper send off that they deserve."
"Thank you. I will request a tombstone be built to honor the soldiers."
"Ok. Thank you."
"I will come back in a second."
"Thank you. Now I will test the water sample. You can stay and watch if you want."
"Okay."
"A man should always defend his country!"
"I am Brian. General Wade's man. Are you the %s Mayor mentioned in the letter?"
"Yes."
"Randall is a brilliant man. He went to fight the Jurchens along the bank."
"What a brave man!"
"Ok! I need a good practice session!"
"We will follow the general at all costs!"
"Hush-, General Wade asked me to come."
"General Wade knows I am here?"
"General Wade knows we are not happy with the Mongols. But as a general he can't take a stand against the Mongols without violating the treaty..."
"You heard it too. The Mongols are up to something!"
"I know. But the realm can't take an official stand against them. You could though...why not go steal a Jurchen uniform and pick a fight with them?"
"Good idea. I will go get one."
"Ugh, this dude clearly hadn't showered for a while..."
"This is not a time to balk at putting on dirty clothing."
"I know. The Mongols are stronger than the Jurchens. If it gets too tough, just retreat. Ok?"
"Ok."
"How did it go?"
"I gave them a good beating. But...[You tell Etan about the supplies.]"
"There are a lot of our supplies here...Could it be...?"
"Etan, what happened?"
"Several days ago, when August's first shipment of supplies arrived, Sanford led a surprise attack on the Jurchens. We lost contact with them."
"So you suspect that Marshal Sanford and the others were ambushed? Do you know Sanders? He was supposed to be escorting the supplies..."
"Sanders? Of course, he is Sanford's old friend, so he went with him. The General needs to know about this. I need to report what we've found..."
"Go. I will stay and check for more clues."
"This clue should lead me to Sanders."
"Practice hard enough, and you won't die so easily!"
"You are %s? I heard you've done us a big favor. Thank you!"
"My pleasure. You stay here because of Alan and Sanders? Because they've been taken by the Jurchens?"
"Yes. They must have left clues for us to find them. But we are too weak to break through the Jurchen barricades now."
"If they really are at the Jurchen camp. I can go there and help them."
"That would be most helpful! But please help us break free from here first!"
"Thank you."
"So what's next?"
"I've arranged to transport the wounded back to our main camp. I'll go to the Jurchen Camp with you and find our captured allies."
"With all due respect, Marshal, you are heavily wounded yourself. You shouldn't come."
"Then at least take this Signal Flare. It will send a signal to our spy in the camp. He will help you."
"Thank you, Marshal."
"Maybe the spy will help me find Aricia too."
"(Cough, cough)"
"You are one of us?"
"Yes. I came to save you. Where is Sanders?"
"They...took him. He is in the front camp in a Chained Wagon. Go save him..."
"Ok. You take care now. I will come back right after."
"I am fine. Go help him!"
"I will be back."
"No! They found me!"
"Sanders! Are you ok...? (Cough, cough)"
"This is not the time for talk. Let me get you two out of here."
"No! I was too careless!"
"Help! Help!"
"There are Jurchens inside. I should put on a disguise."
"The chained wagons are up ahead. Let's see where Sanders is."
"What do you want? I told you I don't know any military intel! Just kill me!"
"Are you Alexander's son, Sanders?"
"Hmph. So you know my family! I won't be blackmailed!"
"Sanders! The Marshal asked me to come and rescue you and Alan!"
"Um? You are one of us?"
"This is not the place. Let me get you out of here."
"Thank you!"
"Your father is worried sick about you."
"Father? I am so sorry!"
"Quickly, let's go!"
"Wait. Alan and I are both wounded. You alone will not be able to fight against all the Jurchens. I have a Bloom Skill Book. It can boost your power."
"Bloom?"
"Yes. A desperate move to turn the tables when one is backed into a corner!"
"Please do teach me."
"Come at me."
"Ok."
"Remember, only use it when it's absolutely necessary, because each use will cost you a Red Star."
"Ok. Thank you."
"Let's go find Alan now."
"He is still in the tent."
"Let's hurry then."
"Let's."
"Burning fire. Ding dong ding."
"We need supplies to make these poor soldiers' food."
"Halt! Who goes there?"
"One of us? Are you with General Wade's army?"
"Yes. I am in Marshal Sanford's division. My charge is to mind the supplies. Who are you?"
"I am %s, here looking for Marshal Sanford."
"The General sent you! Great! We need to get back in contact with the main camp! We were ambushed. And when we fell back, the Mongols cut us off."
"Mongols? They dare break the treaty?"
"They did not attack us. They just blocked the way and wouldn't leave, until the Jurchens caught up with us. Now we are trapped here and our supplies are running low."
"I saw some supplies along the way. I will go collect some and bring them back."
"Great! Thank you! But even with that, we can only last two more days."
"Why don't you try to break free?"
"Two of the scouts who warned us about the ambush were captured. We can't just leave them behind."
"Is one of them Sanders?"
"Yes, he is good friends with our Marshal. That's why he and his friend stayed to help. If you want to know more about him, you should go ask the Marshal."
"I will."
"One day I will show the Jurchens and Mongols what we are made of!"
"Ho! Nice fight you had there!"
"Thank you!"
"I am Anders, a Major in General Wade's army. Care to practice with me?"
"Practice? We need to do more than just practice!"
"I couldn't agree more! The Jurchens have hired a famous mercenary warrior to lead their vanguard. I wish I could give him a good beating!"
"What's his name?"
"Hagan. Even I lost to him once! If you can slay him, I will be impressed!"
"Ok. Just you wait."
"Nicely done! Finally a good day!"
"What was on your mind before?"
"The Mongols, of course! They are up to something shady. But there is not a thing we can do about it, what with the treaty and everything!"
"I do not represent the army. Maybe I can go and check them out."
"Great! But if they catch you, I had nothing to do with this!"
"Haha. Of course!"
"Don't be alarmed. I am a spy."
"They did leave clues. I should signal the spy."
"Who are you? How did you get the flare?"
"Marshal Sanford sent me to find Sanders and Alan."
"Finally! Three days ago, two men were captured and brought to the front camp. They've been left under heavy guard."
"Thank you. But I've got to ask, how did you know about the plan to ambush the Marshal?"
"Honestly, no one in my troop knew about the ambush. The Jurchens have narrowed their search for spies to my troop...I should have done better..."
"Oh. But if they suspect your troop already, won't it be too dangerous for you if you help me?"
"Don't worry about me. Our first priority is to save the others. [Whispers to himself] This is the last thing I can do for the realm. [Raises voice] I know where they are being held. The rest is up to you now."
"Don't worry. I got it."
"How did you get caught? Hurry!"
"You go first! I'll hold them off!"
"No! If they capture you, they will kill you!"
"No. I won't leave you alone!"
"Then have Sanders and Alan go first! We'll stay and hold back the Jurchens!"
"You can't stay here with me! They will know you are the spy!"
"It's ok. I have a plan!"
"Ok, then! Alan, Sanders go!"
"Randall asked me to come help."
"Randall has arranged to make it look like the arsonists have fled. The Jurchens will follow the false trail and leave the camp vulnerable. This is your best chance."
"What's next?"
"The girl is in a tent to the northwest. We will stay here and keep watch. Quickly! Go check!"
"Thanks!"
"It's empty...Aricia, am I too late again?"
"Nobody there? How? We saw that girl only yesterday!"
"I was too late..."
"Don't give up. We will help you keep looking for her. Now we have something else to do here."
"Maybe I could be of help?"
"Great. The Jurchens have got some powerful Bow Designs. We need to get them before they put them to use."
"Where are they kept?"
"According to our intel it's kept in the Jurchen General, Damien's tent. We have to get there!"
"Let's go then."
"No! The general is down! Get the assassins!"
"Get the assassins!"
"No! Get them alive!"
"To hell with it! I am gonna kill them!"
"Hurry! We will hold them, you go get the designs!"
"Take care!"
"Got it! Let's go!"
"Where is she? No matter what, I'm gonna save her!"
"Enter Jurchen Prison"
"...[The man doesn't speak,  just stares at you coldly.]"
"I am here to see Koen and Ramona. Please help me."
"...[He looks you up and down and points a finger at you, as if to say: And who might you be?]"
"I am %s. Koen invited me to come visit. Please point the way for me."
"...[He smiles a wretched, tortured smile, and slowly points to the east, shakes his head, and then points to the west and nods.] "
"[I don't even know him...He points west, but I am not sure whether I should trust him...]"
"He tricked me! Now I'm lost...what is that?"
"%s, stop. We have something to tell you."
"He is not mute!"
"Don't be surprised. We are the Watchers from The Inn. We've stayed here for years to watch and hear what happens."
"But, were Theron, Koen and Ramona not suspicious? How did you escape them?"
"Ha! I will keep that secret. A word of advice. The Creed of Five and the Southern Lords were never on good terms. If you want the truth, you should ask the people who were there."
"Care to elaborate on that?"
"Back then, Orson, Spider Consul and Snake Consul were the main representatives of the realm. Spider Consul is of course now dead and Orson retired, leaving only Snake Consul still in Creed."
"Thanks. I will go find this person."
"Did you come to play?"
"Marks. So I am not alone here. Where do they lead?"
"The marks end here...a whistle? That way!"
"Who are you? Why are you chasing me?"
"I am %s. I am here to see Koen and Ramona. Can you bring me to them?"
"Koen and Ramona? Never heard of them. Did you come to play? Let's play together!"
"Looks like she is not that bright. Is there anyone else on the island?"
"There is me, Lada, auntie, uncle and grandpa. If you play with me, I will take you to see them."
"What do you want to play?"
"I buried a treasure under one of the trees. The tree has five big branches and the lowest one is twisted. You can try to find it, ha."
"[But you just told me where it is.] Ok. I will be right back."
"You are so smart! Yes this is it!"
"Now can you take me to Koen and Ramona?"
"Oh, no! It's empty! It's empty!"
"You sure you hid something in the box? What is it?"
"It's the cake auntie made me! I put the rest of it here!"
"You buried a cake? An animal probably dug it up. The monkeys maybe?"
"Ah! Then you have to go and punish those bad monkeys for me! I was keeping it for later..."
"Ok. Ok. Don't cry."
"Ah~Will they come and steal my cake again?"
"Probably. Lada, can you take me to go see Koen and Ramona now?"
"But I told you I don't know them!"
"[At least she can lead me to someone else I can talk to.] Can you take me to see your aunt then?"
"She is not here. But uncle is."
"Can you take me to him?"
"Seven Stars, I am the only one left. But our name will live on!"
"Thank you for bringing Rihane home."
"It's my pleasure, Sir."
"How time flies. Now I am the only one left of the Seven Stars. And you are the only one left of the Southern Lords. But at least you've grown up to be a good warrior."
"Thank you, Sir. The people that massacred my family remain at large, though..."
"I always suspected they used poisonous worms in the conspiracy. Your family and the others must have been drugged before the attack. That's how they were able to take down all five families at the same time."
"Poisonous worms from the far South? Why would they come to the realm and commit such crimes?"
"You don't know, the Creed of Five used to be well received in the realm. Only the Southern Lords would stand against them."
"And they would massacre our families because of that?"
"I can't say. I guess you will only know when you find out what really happened. Since you are here now, I suggest you stay a while, so you can learn a thing or two from Koen."
"Thank you, Sir. I will go see him now."
"A good man devotes his life to the realm and the people."
"So are you %s?"
"Yes, I am. I have a letter from August here."
"You must be wondering why a stranger would ask you to come all the way to Floret Island, right?"
"Honestly? I am."
"Don't worry, %s. I will help you find the other half of the volume. For the realm, your father and your family."
"Thank you, Koen."
"Ok. You should go get some rest. I need to go find my daughter. She's run off again."
"Let me help too. What does she look like?"
"Thanks. If you see a girl in red, it must be her."
"Ok."
"Did you find Rihane?"
"Yes. But...now she is missing. This is her purse."
"Yes, it is. Ramona made it herself. But she would never take it off. And what's that green stuff here? Did you say she is missing?"
"I met a pair of twin girls in the woods. They said a big toad took her to a cave."
"Toad is one of the most poisonous creatures. We need to get some Venom Suckers, then we can go to the Toad Cave to look for Rihane."
"Ok. I will go get the herb now."
"%s, you are back. And who are your friends?"
"Koen, this is Aricia and Ramon. Both survivors of the massacre."
"More survivors! That's great news. How did Ramon get hurt?"
"I ran into the twin girls again. They told me Aricia was on the island. I went to find her and saw a group of masked men attacking them. That's how he got hurt."
"They have to stay and heal here then."
"Thank you, Koen. I will take care of them."
"Good. %s, you can take them to the rooms there."
"Thank you."
"You grew up well, kid. You have talents. Don't waste them."
"Thank you. This is a rare chance for me to learn from you."
"I will."
"How was it?"
"These skills I learned seemed to have become more powerful. Why is that?"
"How do I conquer it?"
"Practice makes perfect."
"I see. Thanks."
"Do not mess with me! My dad and mom will get you!"
"Who are you? Why are you on my island? Give me my purse!"
"Yes, I am Rihane. Who are you? How do you know my name?"
"Your father is looking for you. Come, let's go back."
"Wait! Why should I listen to you. You could be tricking me! I'm warning you, though: my parents are not ones to mess with."
"I really am a friend. Your father sent me."
"I should be able to answer correctly. Go ahead."
"Tell me who is my dad's master?"
"Logon"
"Seven Stars"
"Old Beggar"
"All of the above"
"Hmph. Everyone knows that. That doesn't mean anything. Again, who is my dad's best friend?"
"Petric"
"Torin"
"Haha. Frey, the Kid is also my dad's friend! Cool, ha?"
"Alright, I know how great your dad is. You can stop it now."
"Hmph. You don't even know that. And you claim you know my dad?"
"Sorry, I misspoke. Let me answer again."
"Ok, I will say my dad did send you then. But I still have things to do here. You can go tell him not to worry."
"What do you need to do? I can help you. "
"Good. Good. Look at those mute men over there. Go send them away."
"Ok. You stay here."
"See? I stayed here, as you said."
"Look the servants are gone now."
"I will give you that. But I am still not done here."
"What do you have to do too?"
"OK!"
"The toad is quite ferocious. I hope Rihane is ok in there."
"The toad is huge with sharp claws. It is not just any toad."
"Why not enter the cave and fight it?"
"That toad is quite poisonous. We need to prepare before we go in."
"How?"
"There are some scorpions under Lonetree Hill. If we mix their tails with the Venom Sucker, it could help us."
"Let me go get some."
"Thank you. Let me mix them."
"Please."
"Put this under your nose. It should protect you against the toad's venom for a few minutes."
"Ok. I will."
"I can handle the beast. Take Rihane out of here!"
"Alright, take care!"
"I'm fine. But Rihane has passed out. I am afraid she has been poisoned. I have some potion still. Put it under her nose and take her out of here."
"OK."
"...[Rihane has passed out.]"
"...What? What is this place? Where is that big toad?"
"Your dad is fighting it. Can you walk? We need to go."
"Ah~ Mom, where are you. I am so scared!"
"Stop it, get up and let's go!"
"You are so terribly slow! Even Blind Master walks faster than you. "
"Finally! This was definitely not an accident. Someone was trying to set me up. My purse repels all poisonous creatures. That toad couldn't have gotten to me on its own!"
"I came as fast as I could! Weren't you the one who lost the purse?"
"No. It was taken! I was worried dad might get angry, so I came out to look for it. It must be the weird servants. They were very bad men, so grandpa muted them and brought them on the island. It must be them."
"Why don't you tell your parents or Blind Master then? They are much more powerful than I am."
"Are you thinking straight? They would never let me get involved in something like this. They would take care of it themselves. But I have a right to know!"
"Ok, then. How do you want me to help?"
"Call them aside and ask them who stole my purse. The guilty one is bound to panic."
"Well, sounds like it could work."
"They attack before I say a word. Guilty indeed!"
"So? Did you find out who?"
"They started fighting me before I could even ask."
"I knew it! I knew it was them! But did you get anything out of them?"
"Umm, they are mute, remember?"
"Right. Anyway, they can write, can't they! They must have a leader of some sort. Find him, search him and see what you can find."
"Good idea."
"Did you find something then?"
"A letter."
"Great. Open it!"
"“飞”是什么？写这个字条的人的名字吗？“上岛者务诛”？说的是你？他们想杀你啊？“阻拦郭靖离岛”……爹要离开桃花岛吗？我怎么不知道？"
"Looks like the servants are being used. And someone doesn't want Koen and Ramona off the island. [As for Pawn...sounds familiar...]"
"Hmm! So they were not even after me! They just wanted to keep dad here."
"This is serious. We should tell your dad now."
"No! I need to find that traitor and stuff him in that gross cave for a year, no 100 years! Eh? Do you hear that? Is that my dad? Let's go see what's going on."
"Aricia...What are you doing?"
"Enter Toad Cave"
"I am young, but I've got skills."
"Huh? She dropped her purse. Where did she go?"
"Hey! Looking for Rihane? Come here."
"Hehe, guess who we are."
"You look exactly the same!"
"A big toad took Rihane into a cave."
"A toad? Which cave?"
"The big black one in the woods? Do you dare to go? The toad will swallow you whole, haha. Go tell her dad. He can kill it. Bye Bye."
"Wait! Who are you? [They do not answer and you decide you better go tell Koen now.]"
"I don't see how Floret Island is special..."
"Wait. Eh? Where are the others?"
"What others? I came here on my own."
"No, no. There are two more. They followed you here. And you have been looking for one of them."
"Aricia? You mean Aricia is here?"
"Yeah. Over there at the Resonance Cliff."
"Thank you!"
"Hey, I am not finished yet!"
"Well, sooner or later."
"Those who know me will know."
"Ramon is hurt. Let him rest. %s, you haven't told me why you are here."
"It's a long story. After you were taken... [You tell her what happened]"
"Look at you! You achieved all that by yourself, but as for me, well... if not for Ramon, I wouldn't be able to see you again."
"Aricia, tell me does he have proof that it was the Creed of Five who massacred our families?"
"How can that be wrong? He found out so much. When he wakes up, he can tell you all about it. Eh? Where is Ramona? I should really go thank her for her hospitality."
"She is not on the island."
"Not here? Haven't Koen and Ramona lived here for a long time? How come she is not here?"
"I don't know...Someone is here."
"You didn't have to come back for this!"
"I need to ask."
"What's left to ask? I am not one of you. I am the granddaughter of Lord Torrance. My name is Accalia, not Aricia...This has all been a ploy. I just needed to use you!"
"No! You were dying when you came to Hidden Village!"
"Haha. Convincing, wasn't it? I only wanted to get the half of the Volume your family had. But you were uniquely useless in getting it!"
"What about us, then?"
"%s, no need to waste your time with her! What are you doing? Come over here!"
"%s, come here. I need to tell you something."
"Aricia...Tell me. Tell me is it all fake? Everything? Everything? You and I?"
"I must finish this mission!"
"Aricia! I need to go help her!"
"%s! What are you doing here? I thought I would never see you again!"
"Aricia, are you hurt? Who is this?"
"This is Ramon. %s, we are the only three surviving souls from the massacre. "
"Survivor? How did you meet him? Weren't you taken by the Jurchens?"
"Jurchen is gone. The soldiers who took me disbanded. Ramon found me and saved me. He found out our enemy is the Creed of Five. But we are not strong enough to fight them..."
"The Creed of Five?"
"Yes! Ramon is sure it was them that slaughtered our families!"
"The Creed of Five!"
"Oh..."
"Ramon is awake! Let's go check on him."
"You are?"
"I am %s, Ramon."
"Aricia's %s? Ah, it hurts!"
"This wound looks particularly bad. Let's find a safer spot to treat you."
"Ok. Thank you."
"My pleasure."
"This is bad. We need to clean his wound."
"Ah!!"
"Thank you for this."
"Always a pleasure. I couldn't thank you enough for saving Aricia."
"No need. We all share the same blood. We support each other."
"Yes. We should stick together."
"Now we are united. We are one step closer to revenge. Have you seen Koen? We came to ask Koen and the Blind Master to join us."
"Yes. With their help, we will have a better chance against the Creed of Five."
"Ramon says it was the Creed. But...Aricia wouldn't lie."
"Haha...I knew this day would come...One of us...would die at the other's hand..."
"Aricia! Don't...Please, you will get better..."
"Ha...You never lied to me once...Don't...start now...The island is so beautiful...So unlike anywhere else in the realm. Could you, could you disperse my ashes out on the sea?"
"Yes. Aricia, yes."
"Truth to be told...I...I didn't always lie to you...I am really happy that I met you...It, it was real...But my country...my people..."
"Aricia..."
"I...I don't regret it though...Just, just...Why are you not Jurchen? Why, why am I not one of you?"
"Aricia!..."
"Aricia, don't worry. I will honor your last wish. You'll sleep here in peace."
"Blind Master is too old for this!"
"This is outrageous, outrageous!"
"Koen...What is going on here?"
"%s, these people you brought here are using the Blind Master to force me to give them my half of the Volume. Did you know about this? Are you working with them?"
"I...I...Aricia! What is going on! There must be a mistake!"
"Mistake? %s, they have a knife at the Blind Master's throat! What a disgrace you are to your family's name!"
"No! Koen, I..I am not..."
"You are not one of them? Prove it! Go take care of the rebelling servants and I will believe you."
"Ok. Ok."
"%s, don't you see? He is not a true warrior! He can't tell right from wrong!"
"Acclia, no need to waste your time."
"You shut up!"
"No...Aricia...it is not true....it must be a nightmare... "
"No! I can't...I must find out what's going on!"
"I'm sorry. But then, this might be a good thing after all. At least you know the truth about her now."
"Good? How could this be considered good in any way?"
"I know you are heart broken. But you can't let yourself wither away like this. Don't let her win like that. Help me save the Blind Master, then we can take them. And you can finally demand an answer."
"Fine. What now?"
"There is a monument over there...[whispers to you about a setup] Got it? Say you know where the Volume is and lure Aricia away. I can take care of Ramon."
"Ok."
"Aricia, I've told %s where the volume is. You can go get it now. "
"Smart choice! Ramon, watch this guy!"
"Can't spare this Ramon! It must be him that turned Aricia into this woman!"
"Master, are you alright?"
"Hmm! He wouldn't have hurt me!"
"Good. Please go get some rest. %s and I can handle these two."
"Alright then."
"Aricia claims to be Torrance's granddaughter, but Petric, my best friend who went rogue, was Torrance's only son. Does that mean she's Petric's daughter? It can't be. His wife only had one son...so what are we to make of this?"
"Koen! What are you mumbling about?"
"Go wake up Ramon. We need to get more information out of him. This pill will save somebody on the brink of death, but leaves them incapacitated for a while. Use it on him."
"I see."
"The Jurchen country is gone and the Jurchens are struggling for survival. Torrance tried everything to get his hands on the Volume of War. Now it's Accalia, aka Aricia."
"But Koen, I've known Aricia, no, I mean Accalia, my whole life. I don't believe anyone could put on a show for so long."
"I know how you feel. I was fooled once too. Some people can rip your heart out, and you still can't bring yourself to hate them."
"Koen..."
"Ashes to ashes. I sent Rihane to keep an eye on Accalia. Hurry and bring Ramon over there too. I wish Ramona was here. She would have found a way to make these two talk."
"Ugh, speaking of which...I told Aricia that Ramona is not here..."
"What? Well...What's done is done. Take this one to Rihane now."
"Dad! Dad! Aricia got away!"
"How? Tell us how!"
"She knocked me down somehow, I think she did something to my chakras - I couldn't move. She ran towards the dock."
"You let your guard down! %s, come, we have to catch her!"
"No! I...I didn't mean to...Why didn't you move! Aricia!"
"Accalia, I can understand that you wish to serve your country, but you will never get the Volume of War from us!"
"No need for chit chat. Koen, you rank among the grandmasters. I assume you wouldn't want to bully a nobody like me. I wish to fight %s. Please step away."
"%s, remember how scared you were when you saw my wounds the first time we met? Haha! You know what I was thinking? I was thinking how soft you were, haha."
"That woman met my grandfather when he was wounded too, and nursed him back to health. That's why he married her and took in her son and make him a lord..."
"And my grandmother and my own father shoved me away like I was nobody. I am his blood! And he would treat me so because of that woman!"
"If only I was a boy, then we might have had a chance. My father and grandmother hated me for being a girl, so when the master chose me, they were so relieved. Finally they were able to get rid of me..."
"Oh, you thought you just happened to be the first one that found me? haha"
"Oh, what? You are mad? haha. You really should learn to hide your emotions better, you know? It's just annoying. But despite everything...you are the only person that ever really cared about me, you know that?"
"So to repay your kindness, I might as well tell you...your enemy is not the Creed of Five, it is...my grandfather, Torrance! He had the southern lords and their families massacred."
"There is no way I can get away today. So I might just give you a life for the Gam, no my grandfather's sins. "
"We must find Accalia!"
"%s, I am so sorry."
"Koen, Aricia wishes to have her ashes dispersed into the sea here, would you allow that?"
"Ashes to ashes. Whatever she did when she was alive doesn't matter now. Let her have her dying wish. I will give you some privacy."
"Thank you, Koen."
"Aricia, I'm here. I won't leave you again."
"Why? Why did we have to be born enemies? Why?"
"You are my best friend. Always were, always will be. %s is lucky to have met you! But now you must go. Aricia, rest in peace..."
"You! How dare you talk to me that way! Stop! I said stop right there!"
"How may I serve you, your majesty?"
"I just want to tell you that my dad has already asked my mom to set off for River Town to join Uncle August for the summit. I am going too. Would you...like to come with us?"
"Sorry, the summit is no place for me."
"You! Why are you refusing our hospitality?! That woman lied to you your whole life, and you are still so caught up with her! You should thank the heavens that she is dead!"
"Rihane, that's enough!"
"So what?"
"Right, right. I am no one to mess with you. But I can run. Farewell, princess!"
"Eh? Why would they tie down an old man like that? Let me go take a look."
"Hey! Yes, you! Come! Come over here!"
"You look like you have some talent. Say, let's be best buddies!"
"Phew! Farewell, fishnets! Oh, the sweet air of freedom!"
"Now that you are free, I should take my leave."
"Hey, no, no! You are no fun! Say let's explore this Brook, eh?"
"I am sorry. I am just not in an exploring mood."
"Haha! To hell with exploring. Let's make some trouble for Danton! Let's play with those guards. You can collect their weapons and meet me over there at the bridge!"
"I...Oh, wait! [Frey already left for the bridge.]"
"What a kid! Well, might as well humor him. Maybe he would help get me to the Far South."
"Haha! Nice! You are so young yet so talented! Let's be best buddies forever!"
"What? No,no! This is too inappropriate!"
"Why inappropriate? You think I am too old? Too weak? But you know there are only two or three people that are my match in battle!"
"No, it's not that. Let's drop it for now. How do you want to handle the weapons?"
"Oh, I almost forgot about those! Here, drop them all down the cliff. That will piss them off!"
"Ugh, really?"
"Enough, enough. I am getting thirsty."
"What now?"
"Haha. Look at those monkeys. They must have some Monkeys Wine. I want to have some!"
"What is Monkeys Wine?"
"You don't know what you are missing out on! The monkeys store fruits in tree trunks and over time they turn into this wine. Oh, it tastes ever so delicious!"
"Fine. I'll go get some then. If nothing else, it will help drown my sorrows."
"Haha! Good, ha? Hey, slow down! Leave some for me!"
"Let me drink the sorrow away!"
"Sorrow, what sorrow?"
"It's not a big deal. Just been lied to by a friend I held really dear. Then I killed her..."
"Wow! Isn't that a bit too extreme, buddy! I've lied to and played a lot of people. If every one of them was like you, I would have died a thousand times!"
"You wouldn't understand."
"Guess what? I've seen a lot, my friend. Tell me what happened."
"It's a long story...[You tell Frey your story.]"
"Well, it is pretty bad, I will give you that...Wait, who did you say you are? A descendant of the Southern Lords?"
"Yes."
"Oh, my heavens - I didn't know some of you still lived! Well, Accalia was Jurchen, and Kai had some connection to the Jurchen, therefore it seems likely they were in the same gang."
"Yeah, they were all Jurchen."
"But even though Jurchen is gone, it would take a very commanding figure to order a princess around..."
"You mean the Jurchen have managed to keep in place some kind of power hierarchy?"
"Yeah...All this talk of Jurchen has given me a headache. Let's take a walk and give Danton some more trouble. "
"Play time again..."
"Look how many people Danton has stationed here? What is he up to?"
"The Brook is certainly a good place to do dirty trades."
"See, you think so too? Danton looks like a upright dude, but he is in fact the worst of them all!"
"You have a plan?"
"Yep. Let's split up and check this place out. If you find anything give a shout and I will meet you back here. I want to see what dirty deeds Danton has been up to."
"I see."
"I should really focus on finding an exit too."
"Where did that come from? The music is so enchanting and yet tormenting...Better find Frey now."
"Ugh-oh. Here comes real trouble!"
"Frey, do you know where the music is coming from?"
"No, no! I can't have him see me like this."
"Who? And why are you acting so strange?"
"Strange! No, I am acting perfectly normal. Just, ah, look over there! And I'm off!"
"Hey! Where are you going? Frey!"
"Why did Frey, the Kid run? Who's there?"
"Danton! You insolent bast... I will see the end of you!"
"Hahahaha..."
"Who is that laughing? The laughter seems to cut into me like a knife..."
"That's what we ghosts do! Did Danton send you? Did he send you to check my rotten bones?"
"You mean owner of the brook Danton, that Danton?"
"Ha, and this one pretends not to know the bastard."
"But I really don't know him. What are you doing here?"
"Haha, what am I doing here? Do you not see? I am a cripple! Danton pushed me down the cliff and here I am. What a husband, eh? If I can't kill him, I'll haunt him for the rest of his days!"
"Ugh, lady, I am lost here too..."
"Let me up the stakes. Do you know Ance of the Iron Fist? I am his sister, Laila! If you help me, Iron Fist will reward you!"
"But my lady,  the school of the Iron Fist disappeared after its chief died."
"What? Ance? Ance is dead?"
"Yeah, he fell down a cliff a dozen or so years ago..."
"No! Liar! Ance was invincible, a fall down a cliff would not kill him! He has skills, excellent skills!"
"Well, honestly, I don't know how it happened."
"No, I will get to the bottom of this! You go slay the alligators on the bank while I think. Then I will tell you the way out."
"Ok then."
"Haha! Well done! Danton's pet is in that shallow water, you know? The Alligator King he calls it."
"I've seen it. It's huge."
"Hmm, so what? See those monkeys? They have something called the Monkeys Wine."
"And?"
"Alligators will drink it too, if they have some. It will make them loopy."
"I think my earlier efforts at getting the monkey wine cleared them out."
"They must have stored more elsewhere. Look in places where the monkeys gather in larger numbers."
"Ok then."
"You were gone long."
"They hid it very well."
"Whatever. Put the wine on that boulder, it will draw the Alligator King out. When it's drunk it, you can slay it easily enough."
"You sure it will drink it?"
"Well, we won't know until you try."
"[Better be smart about this.]"
"How did you get in the brook, ay? Can you find your way back?"
"Um...Don't you know how to get out?"
"Hmm, I got in from the hole above. You want to climb out? Since you were able to get here, you can probably go back the way you came. "
"Ugh. But Frey and I made quite a bit of noise coming through that way."
"Might still be a better option than climbing out from here. You and Albelt can go check. If no one is there, wouldn't it be the best?"
"Right."
"They are just following orders. Isn't that too extreme?"
"Nothing they suffer can compare to what I have gone through. Just go punish them!"
"...Ok."
"Hahaha! Good! Good!"
"This hatred is destroying you."
"…[This man looks cold as stone. Sharp light shines from his half closed eyes.]"
"…[This man looks cold as stone. His eyes see you, but his face says he doesn't. Despite your intrusion, he keeps on playing.]"
"Sir, please stop playing."
"…[He ignores you and keeps playing. The music takes on an even more enchanting, seductive melody.]"
"Stop now, or I will make you!"
"You are %s?"
"And you are?"
"You saved my granddaughter on Floret Island."
"You are the Island Master? It's an honor and a pleasure!"
"No one is thanking you. If you hadn't gone to the island, Rihane wouldn't have been abducted in the first place. You are very much to blame, too."
"Shouldn't you be blamed too then, since you were the one who brought the servants to the island?"
"But, it would depend on whether you have the courage..."
"No matter the cost, I will avenge the Southern Lords!"
"Good. I didn't read you wrong. Did you know you've been followed? Accalia's people, I would guess. Before we move forward, I require that you remove them."
"You mean those Men in Black, lurking in the shadows?"
"You knew. Off you go deal with them then. I will take my leave."
"Until next time."
"Huh? A Go piece...odd. I'll ask about it later."
"Yes. That's what I want. Take this Armor. Do cast it whenever you can. You will see the difference."
"Thank you."
"Danton! Let me go, or I promise you, your precious Veiled Brook will suffer!"
"You don't look like you are from here. Where did you come from?"
"I saw them take you, so I followed."
"Haha, a nosy one! Good! But did the guards see you?"
"No, they didn't."
"Good. Good. Come and free me from these annoying chains. Danton chained me like a dog!"
"I would need a tool to spring open these chains. In any case, I heard you were locked up like this because you stole. What if you got what you deserved?"
"Kiddo, you really don't know who I am? I am Frey, the Kid. I would never...Well, Danton is forcing a nice young lady to marry him. I thought it distasteful, so I was going to mess him up, but he caught me..."
"Frey? You are the Frey!"
"Yeah, I am. So you've heard of me after all. "
"Of course! It's an honor to meet you!"
"Blah, blah. I don't care. You look gloomy. Why not cheer yourself up and mess with Danton?"
"Who is this Danton you speak of?"
"He is the owner of Veiled Brook. I just don't like a hypocrite like him. See if I don't smash this cell of his! No one will be kept here again! Ha!"
"I'll help."
"Haha! Danton must be furious. This is so fun! haha! Why aren't you laughing?"
"I don't think it's that funny."
"You are no fun! Well, just get me out of these chains. I will go play elsewhere."
"...How?"
"Ah! I had this great dagger on me when I was captured. A perfect tool for breaking free of bindings like these."
"I see they stationed a few guards. They must have secured the location for a reason. Let me go check."
"So? Was it there?"
"Is it this one?"
"Yes, yes! Hurry, cut me loose!"
"Ok. Try to stay still."
"I must find a way out of here with Adrial."
"Huh? Who goes there?"
"Friend, I am Albelt, this is Emerald. We are trapped here. Do you happen to know a way out?"
"I am %s. Sadly, I am trapped here too."
"Ha, oh well. %s, how did you get here?"
"I was heading to the Far South and saw them abducting Frey, so I followed them here. Why are you here?"
"I followed Frey here too and found someone I'd been looking for for years. But she is to marry Emerald's father. I want to take her away, but Danton wouldn't let me. Emerald tried to help and got trapped too."
"I see. You two are soaked. You should probably get warm first."
"I saw a pack somewhere. There must be something we can use in it."
"I'll go get it."
"Looks like this way is a no go."
"Guess we have to climb out now."
"I saw some vines and wood along the way. Lashed together, they should be able to support a good amount of weight."
"You mean to..."
"Yea. You and I would be able to climb up, but Emerald and Laila won't be able to. The only way is for us to go up first and then pull them up."
"Ok. Let's go get some vines and wood."
"These should be enough. Let's tie the vines into a rope"
"Let's."
"This is a good rope. %s, tie this end to the wood."
"Good. Now one of us needs to go up with this rope."
"Let me."
"I should probably go up first. I have a few more years of practice than you do. While I am climbing, keep alert in case there is any trouble. "
"Ok. Be careful!"
"Alright. Once I am up there, I will throw down the rope. %s you come up first and then we can pull Laila and Emerald up."
"Ok, got it."
"His skills are excellent!"
"Well done!"
"Thank you."
"Emerald has helped Laila tie the rope. We can pull her up now."
"Ok."
"No! Not now!"
"Who is that?"
"That is Danton's first apprentice, Namurt. He is good. On equal terms I could best him, but we're at a disadvantage at the moment."
"Keep pulling. Let me handle him."
"%s, with you here, I might be able to save Adrial after all. Thank you."
"We need to have a solid plan."
"No one knows his weaknesses better than Laila. Danton is forcing Adrial to marry him tonight. We need to hurry."
"Tonight? Hurry!"
"All of Veiled Brook thought Laila was dead. When she shows up tonight, it will raise questions. Then Emerald can tell them all how he tried to murder his wife and daughter. His support should evaporate."
"Good plan. Let's go."
"Why would father do this to me? I am his only daughter..."
"This belonged to the brook. Frey stole it. Why is it here?"
"Frey must have hidden it here. You are Danton's biological daughter?"
"Yes. I never thought he could do such a thing to his own daughter...Albelt and Adrial are in love with each other. He can't force Adrial to marry him! But when I tried to help Albelt, he..."
"Emerald. Your mother has lived down here for more than a dozen years, did you know that?"
"Mother? Mother is alive? But why wouldn't she come see me? Father said she passed away right after I was born. I never knew her face! Is she really here?"
"[Looks like she really doesn't know.] I don't know much about what happened. But I can take you to her."
"%s, you brought people with you!"
"I am Albelt and this is Emerald, my lady."
"Emerald...Do you have a birth mark on your waist? Come, come let me see!"
"You really are my mother. But father said you passed away..."
"When I was pregnant with you, he cheated on me with a maid! I wanted to leave, but he wouldn't let me. He forced me stay until I gave birth."
"Right after you were born, he drugged me, broke both my arms and legs and threw me down into this cave to die!"
"What kind of cruelty is this...!"
"He is a snake, not a man! Emerald, how did you come here?"
"Emerald was trying to get the Spring Pill for me. Danton found out and pushed her down the cliff."
"What? He pushed her down! What do you need the Spring Pill for?"
"Danton poisoned me with Spring Bloom Poison and demands that Adrial marry him in exchange for the cure."
"That bastard! %s, come here!"
"My father is really so bad...?"
"I am sorry, Emerald. But he really is not a good father."
"He used to be...But he changed."
"You don't look affected at all by any of this."
"That wouldn't help get me out of here, would it? This is nothing compared to what I already went through."
"No! I don't believe you!"
"So you are helping Albelt now? How did you get here? Didn't we throw you two in a cell?"
"Your dear master threw us here."
"You liar! We treated them like honored guests, inviting them to the wedding instead of treating them like the criminals they are! Albelt is set on sabotaging the wedding and taking away the master's bride, yet he claims to be the good guy!"
"Only you would believe that."
"Whatever, you are not getting out of here! Brothers, get them!"
"As you please!"
"You have defeated me, sure, but you will not be leaving this place so long as I am still breathing!"
"So stubborn! Do you see that lady? That is Danton's wife, Laila!"
"No, Laila is long gone."
"Open your eyes and see! Your master threw her down here."
"You are Danton's first apprentice? It is true that you are not permitted to taste meat or blood, correct?"
"How do you know about that?"
"May I ask who modified your master's skills?"
"His passed wife..."
"Haha! Passed? I am right here. But he won't be soon!"
"As soon as we pull the lady up you will see the truth with your own eyes!"
"What tricks are you playing?"
"Tricks? If you really believe in Danton, you need not worry about us."
"Who is that down there?"
"It's Emerald."
"What? You better not be lying to me!"
"Today your debt shall be repaid!"
"Good! I can easily take the whole lot of you!"
"Don't you feel even a little ashamed of what you've done?"
"Ashamed? Heavens no. Why would I? This woman forced me to kill...the woman I loved. She would bully me every day. She deserves everything she has brought upon herself!"
"She might have been wrong too. But how can you force someone to marry you now?"
"If that Albelt hadn't come here, Adrial and I would have long been married! She gave me her word. I don't need to explain anything to you. You are all going to die anyway!"
"How despicable! "
"Looks like Albelt has found good help."
"Help will always come to those who are just!"
"Just? I saved her life. She promised to marry me. Is it unjust to make her keep her word?"
"She doesn't want to now. And you can't make her!"
"But she can go back on her word, right? You are too funny!"
"You!"
"We are not too late!"
"Now that I have Adrial back, I'll never leave her again. I promised to help Laila in exchange for the Spring Pill. As soon as I'm cured, I'll return to the Immortals Tomb with Adrial."
"Treasure each other."
"You will no doubt continue towards the Far South. If I was not poisoned, I could go with you, but now..."
"It's ok. I hear Master Sem is very wise. Perhaps he will know how to cure you. When I get to Dali, I can find out."
"Thank you. But I fear you might not be strong enough for the Far South yet. Perhaps you should stay here and practice for a while just in case."
"I will. Until next time, Albelt."
"Danton! Today is the day you pay for your sins!"
"You want to know how to break Danton's defense? What's in it for me?"
"Haha. We are on the same team. Help me and you help yourself."
"We'll need Emerald for this one. Just you wait. Once his defense is down, he will panic and call all the apprentices on you. Make sure you are prepared."
"Got it."
"Giddy off."
"Ok."
"%s, finally!"
"August! What's the matter?"
" Koen still has some things to tell you. He was really angry that Rihane drove you off the island. If not for Ramona, she would have gotten a good beating."
"[But she didn't, did she?] What things?"
"Koen knows that you are going after the Creed of Five. But we fear it is far too imprudent for you to challenge an entire creed alone."
"My mind is made up."
"We know. The Mongols are planning an attack. We can't really go help you, but here is a letter from Koen to Master Sem at the Temple of Dragons in Dali. Hopefully he will help you."
"Thank you! Until next time, August!"
"Climb to the top from here."
"It's time to shut up and show us what you are made of!"
"By all means!"
"You woman! I am going to kill you! Apprentices!"
"Why don't you think about how you ended up like this?"
"You are wasting your time! Enough with your moral lectures!"
"When you face evil, you must harden your heart."
"The courtyard is this way."
"I hear music. It should not be far."
"%s, come with me."
"Is there peace?"
"The Mongols are coming south. Song has no men to spare to aid us. There will be no recovery if Dali is lost. I will have the temple work together with the Spider Consul to hunt down Logan."
"Great. Thank you, master! But what of Soren?"
"Soren...He lost his mind years ago. It would be rather fortuitous if he should recover at this particular time. But we have no time for futile hope at a time like this. Black Swordsmen have been spotted outside."
"I have fought with Logan's Men in Black before. If they are his men, I will be able to tell."
"You mean to go test them?"
"Indeed."
"How did it go?"
"They do use the same skills."
"So these are Jurchen men too. If Soren is working with Logan, it could be the end of both Dali and Song."
"What should we do?"
"If Soren has returned, the first thing he would do is restore his House to its former glory. Logan would go to him and regroup too."
"I will go to Desert Crest then."
"I admire your valor. Be very careful."
"Thank you, master. Until next time."
"Dali is such a heavenly place. What a shame it's troubled with plague."
"Right on time. I need some herb soup."
"Mercy asked me to bring it."
"Spring Bloom...There is still Spring Bloom in this realm? I would be able to find a cure, but the people in Dali need me now."
"If you help Albelt, I will do everything I can to help here."
"Good. The more the merrier. I need to see how the patient reacts to this medicine. Can you give this to him?"
"Ok."
"After taking the medicine, he started struggling and seemed in severe pain. Then he vomited and in his vomit, there was a gross looking black worm."
"Um, I have an idea..."
"Please tell me."
"The medicine kills the parent worm. Usually the baby worm would then just go to sleep. But instead this one tried to escape the host and become a new parent worm."
"How should we handle it?"
"I need more time and testing. There are some Pangolins in the woods. I will need their claws to grind into the medicine."
"I will go get some."
"Thank you."
"My pleasure."
"Now we need to watch this pot carefully. Add in the claw crumbs when I tell you, okay?"
"But I've never done this before..."
"No need to worry. Just follow my instructions when I give them."
"Ok."
"Now, put it in."
"The Creed of Five's spies? We need to hurry and get  the cure to the people now. We can't give them time to sabotage it."
"Indeed."
"The cure is ready. Would you go with Mercy to drop these four patches into the four wells in the city? With luck, the people will all recover."
"Ok. What about Albelt?"
"It will be a great challenge to tackle the Spring Bloom Poison. I plan to set off to see the patient immediately."
"Great."
"As you wish, master. "
"%s, I will go first. Meet you at the West Well."
"One has been dropped here. Let's go to the one in the center of the city."
"I know what it's like to suffer from a poison."
"I can feel their pain. But you had no reason or obligation to help. I admire that you did anyway."
"Namo Emituofo"
"I need one more ingredient for this medicine. But it is very difficult to get."
"I can try get it."
"It's called the Golden Herb. It grows in Malice. But it is too dangerous a place for one to go..."
"It's ok. I am strong."
"Thank you! If you go see Lillian in River Town, she will show you how to get there."
"Ok. I will be right back."
"May you return safely."
"Master, here are the Golden Herbs. Hope it will help."
"Master Healer: Good. I can use it right now."
"Master Healer: Good. Good. This makes sense."
"Master Healer: It is ready!"
"Eh? He is not here! Was it a lie?"
"What a pity. What a pity there's no one to enjoy the view with."
"Cute...Kellye got an outsider involved. Do you know you are in trouble?"
"What do you mean?"
"Guess."
"This is a setup, young one. Don't be so serious...If they are just plagued and crazy, how would they know to gather and protest at the palace?"
"Who might you be?"
"Ezra from The Inn is my boss. I am the Inn Council, Scooper."
"Sorry, never heard of you."
"What? Well, next topic. Kellye set you up! You interfered with the Creed of Five's business. Trouble is coming your way!"
"Thank you for reminding me. But I am more interested in the information she promised me."
"Oh, pity, I sent Kellye to do other business."
"Like hell  you did..."
"Well, I can still tell you about it, that is if you do me a small favor."
"What is it?"
"So I have this pill here. Its smell irritates the worms. If you stay in one place long enough, the worms around are going to get restless. Then their master will show and you can slay him."
"Worm? Oh, what is that smell!"
"Heavens, who farted?"
"Did they move the bathroom here?"
"Ah! Make it go away!"
"How strong is it?"
"Strong."
"This is the only thing other than the parent worm that would make a worm restless."
"I believe it's making people restless too. Tell me, who can cure Albelt?"
"Well, since you are so keen. I will tell you for 500 Coins. Yes?"
"Why don't you just rob me instead?"
"Ok, here you go."
"Is there another way?"
"It's The Inn's rules. We do not give away intel for free."
"I...You!"
"[Takes out a note and writes: Stupid one with lots of cash. Come right away.  And then leisurely ties the note to a pigeon and sends it off.] Ok, let's continue..."
"What the...!"
"Well, you can work with me."
"Enlighten me."
"Spring Bloom is extremely rare. I've never heard of anyone able to cure it without the Spring Pill. One of Master Sem's friends, The Curer, as he is sometimes called, might be able to help."
"How do I get to him?"
"You can work with me and I can introduce you."
"Work with you how?"
"The Inn just got a new deal. We need to unravel some secrets in the Creed of Five. But we don't have eyes in there...yet."
"So?"
"All you need to do is to get close to their local representative, one of the ten Guardians. Then you can get close to the five consuls, then the Enforcer and the Grand Council. And then, you get to the Head of the Creed. Simple."
"Yeah, right."
"Seth is...slain!"
"Hurry and report to the Chief and Logan!"
"This dynamite needs to go."
"What? Dead? Seriously? You blew it! Now the Creed of Five is really on your ass!"
"I didn't think a Guardian would be so weak. And I caught him placing dynamite around town."
"Ah, what a headache. But what is the Creed up to?"
"What's done is done. Now you can introduce me to the Curer."
"Blank."
"Ah...My son! My grandson!"
"Old Nan: You killed my son! And now you come for my grandson! I will kill you!"
"Altar Guard: What are you doing? No more throwing dung on the sculpture!"
"Old Nan: You deserve it! The heavens are watching!"
"Altar Guard: Catch her and use her blood to cleanse the sculpture!"
"Why did you save me? Life has no meaning to me now."
"No. When there is life, there is hope."
"My grandson is but a little baby. And they..."
"What's done is done. Try make peace with it."
"But I can't. My husband died young. My son and daughter are all I had. Then the witch took my son. And now my daughter has a boy. And the plague took him too..."
"Madam, it's not safe here. Let's go talk somewhere else."
"My son would still be alive if not for that witch from the Creed! Now their plague has killed my only grandson!"
"I should never had sent my boy to study medicine. If not, he wouldn't have gone to the mountain for herbs. And he wouldn't have met that witch..."
"Her toad took his life!"
"And she said she loved him. But she was one of those that fled and left him to die when he caught the toad poison."
"She wouldn't even come and say goodbye! And she was all that my son asked for in the end..."
"My poor boy...My poor grandson."
"Madam, do you know who that woman is?"
"I shall never forget! Adora is her name! Once she ran to my house and asked for my son. I wouldn't let her in. And a lot more of them came and surrounded my house."
"What is that?"
"She seemed to have run away from the Creed. And they wanted her back. Toad Consul, Chief blah, blah...I thought she was probably someone high up."
"[She must be the Toad Consul then?]"
"Ouch..."
"You are hurt after all. Let me get you some herbs for it."
"You said you want to find more about them? I heard they talk about something around the altar."
"Sweepers?"
"The worms they used are not common worms. Nobody outside Creed would know how to kill them. And the Guardians can control the infected somehow."
"What? They did say that?"
"They said the Chief just came up with the idea recently. And no one knows the depth of it."
"I need to go handle this."
"Behold the mighty Consuls."
"I heard what he said."
"What do you think?"
"Funny, I want to know what you think."
"I am an outsider. I can't interfere."
"He has been kept here for 8 years and remains unharmed. You must have something to do with that."
"You already have a plan, don't you?"
"You got me. An outsider on our holy ground. You should know what's coming next. Come, take this one down!"
"No. Let me rephrase."
"I am an orphan. The last Snake Consul, my master's father, adopted me. I grew up together with master. And once he inherited the seat, he made me a Guardian."
"But why didn't you rescue him from here?"
"No, I put him here. After Banes took over, he had the Scorpion Consul murdered and forced the Enforcer to resign so no one could challenge him. If I hadn't had him put in prison, he might have lost his life as well."
"And you would let Banes do as he pleases?"
"No, I strive to be his trusted servant so that...But this...He planned to create a plague and then play the savior to earn a reputation that would make him and the Creed welcome in Song."
"What are you going to do about it then?"
"I have plans. But it's none of your business. You are not getting out of this."
"Not so fast."
"Banes listened to Logan and wants to have Karsten removed. He suspects my loyalty. He let me handle this worm scheme to force me to evil. I came here to take my master away with me...and flee."
"Let's get on it then."
"Karsten: Oh."
"Better get out of this creed mess soon!"
"8 years. Everything, changed."
"You are? Who are you?"
"Who are you? Why are you held here? Have you seen others here?"
"I, alone, 8 years. Snake Consul. I. Karsten."
"Aren't you supposed to be high up? How did you come to be down here?"
"Grand Council Banes. Betray. Head. Killed. He kill me. Held. Kerr...here. Go!"
"What?"
"Master. Who are you talking to? A mouse?"
"Kerr. Don't. Not good. Do. Right thing."
"My apprentice. Kerr. Banes likes him. Powerful. Not bad. I know him. Good. He will leave. Banes."
"But has he? I heard he is going to be the new Snake Consul."
"No. He. Good. Won't. Betray. Me. I. Can't. Talk. You. Talk. Him. [He looks at Kerr with such hope.]"
"...[They really are master and apprentice?]"
"Come have some of my worm!"
"What are you looking at?"
"Get out of here."
"Don't bother me!"
"Kerr is here! You are gonna die."
"Who is there? How dare you trespass at the altar! Behold the Holy Five!"
"How dare we? You traitorous villians have no room to talk."
"How dare you! Take this one down! Drain its blood!"
"See if you can!"
"Master Healer has gone to Albelt. If the cure doesn't work now people will die. I need to stop the Creed!"
"Whose side are you on? Karsten or the Grand Council?"
"I am on no one's side! Take this!"
"You think me a fool? No one dares make an enemy of the Creed unless they are well connected."
"Evil and corrupted. Enough with the talk. Where is your prison? And have you taken The Inn's men?"
"What inn? Which inn?"
"You don't know? Then you're useless!"
"Who knew such a place was under the altar..."
"What goes around comes around."
"Dali is locked down. What are you doing here?"
"I am %s, here to see Master Sem. Are you from the Temple of Dragons?"
"You can't just show up and demand to see the master. I'm currently investigating the death of a Creed Guardian we have been blamed for. You should go back. This is not a good time to visit Dali."
"No need to investigate. I killed him."
"You? You're the one that made us the scapegoat? And now you demand to see the master? You have some gall. But I like that. You need shelter?"
"Shelter?"
"You have no where to go. Might as well do some chores for me. The creed wouldn't dare bother you if you come with me."
"Ok, then."
"This is Master Sem's apprentice. If I follow him, I probably will find the Curer."
"I have something for you to do. "
"Please tell me."
"Climb the mountain and collect some Purple Love. Then go to the waterfall and get a bucket of Spring Water."
"Why so specific?"
"Why what? Get on with it! Come back to the hub to see Master Healer and I when you're done."
"How rude! He sounds like Laila. Are they related?"
"This must be where the Spring Water is."
"Prison under the altar? The Creed would dare mess with The Inn? And who is this lady? Can I trust her?"
"You have everything?"
"Yes."
"Not bad. That man over there is the Master Healer, Kerm. He is helping cure the patient we brought back."
"He looks busy. I should go..."
"Go check on the medicine in the pot. If it's ready bring it to him."
"Ok."
"What a strong smell! It must be very bitter..."
"I saw shadows outside. There must be spies."
"We can't afford any interference now that the cure is nearly ready."
"That must be why they are here. %s, guard the master. I will go handle them."
"No. It might be a trick to lure you away. Let me go check first."
"Ok. Hurry back."
"Ok."
"Take care."
"Master. Gage is here to see you."
"I am hoping you could help a friend."
"Continue."
"He was poisoned by Spring Bloom and recently the Ice Needle. He is dying. Master, please help."
"Is he called Albelt?"
"Yes. How did you know?"
"%s asked me to help him too. I am on my way to River Town now."
"Thank you, master!"
"We are done here. I need to go back to the temple. By the way, when you were in Veiled Brook did you see my sister?"
"[You suddenly feel like the answer to your question will be unwelcome] What's her name?"
"Laila."
"You are her brother! No wonder...Uh, she is not doing so good...[You tell him what happened at the brook.]"
"Danton would be so vicious! When things settle down here, I will ask for leave and go avenge my sister!"
"Ance, no, Mercy. Calm down. Eh? The Creed! We had better see what they're up to, lest they sabotage the cure."
"Seth is slain and we don't know who it was. The Chief must know about this."
"That old one at Temple of Dragons has a visitor. He has quite a reputation...This is not good."
"Do you think Chief Banes can really lead us back to Song?"
"If Ana was half as good as Banes, we wouldn't be in this position in the first place."
"You can't call the former chief by her name!"
"She is a dead traitor. I can call her whatever I want."
"Cheif Banes? How many chiefs does the Creed have?"
"How can the chief be a traitor?"
"If it's true, the Creed would turn on the temple. And that is not good."
"Yes. But it may not be true just because she said she heard it."
"The altar is right there. Why not go and confirm?"
"That lady did say there's a hidden prison. Two birds one stone."
"The heavens have abandoned Dali!"
"No visitors!"
"Dali is in lock down. Do not attempt to cross this point."
"Please go back. "
"What is going on?"
"Dali is suffering from a plague. No one is allowed in or out. It would be good for you if you leave now."
"Plague? How serious?"
"Very, I am afraid. The infected attack anyone, even members of their own family. A single scratch from them can get you infected."
"What measures are being taken to stop the spread?"
"We've lost many men attempting to contain it. Now we must rely on the Creed. There is no cure yet. You shouldn't go in. If you must, at least smoke your clothes with herbs."
"Thank you."
"He doesn't sound optimistic."
"Still I will advise you not to go in. But as you wish."
"I should go in and help. You were talking about the Creed. Can you tell me more?"
"Most of our people got infected when they were trying to quarantine the citizens. Only the Creed can use some kind of spell to put the infected to sleep, which is the only way the plague can be contained now."
"Haven't they always had a bad reputation?"
"Dali is where the Creed resides. They have to help - it is a threat to their survival, too. But I do not see why their spells are more effective than our prayers? Is faith not our best ally?"
"Faith is not medicine. I should go in now."
"Blocked...The infected are victims. I must be careful not to hurt them too badly."
"Indeed. We need to find the cure..."
"Does trouble follow me? Or do I chase trouble?"
"Hey, we meet again! How have you been since Floret Island?"
"...Floret Island..."
"Oops, sorry. Too soon? But it's been a year already. Time to cheer up, no?  What are you doing here, anyway?"
"To seek a cure for a friend. Why are you here?"
"I'm here because of the plague, of course! A hearer goes where the wind blows. Your friend Albelt? Who do you think can help? Even Ramona tried and failed."
"You seem to know everything. Why don't you give me a hint?"
"Me? You think I dare sell information without orders from the Inn? No."
"What if you help me with some information then?"
"I will think about it, if you do something for me."
"What is it?"
"The Inn never directly interferes, but innocent people are being forced to suffer here. Drive away the infected around the palace - try not to hurt them - and I will tell you who can help Albelt. Deal?"
"Deal. But what do you mean, forced to suffer?"
"Nothing. Go do your job!"
"Ok, I hope you deliver your end of the deal."
"We are dying here, and the nobles do not care!"
"Not true! The king is trying everything to contain the plague! What are you doing? You want to rebel against the King?"
"Why not! We are going to die anyway!"
"I need to stop this before anyone gets hurt."
"No, I didn't see what the assassin looks like!"
"This is bad. Have you got any medicine?"
"It won't help. One of his chakra is sealed. No medicine can help with that. We need to open it again and fast."
"You must know a way."
"There is a Spirit Fox in the Black Marsh. Its blood will help reopen the chakra. But it is extremely swift and alert. We may have a better chance of catching it if we lure it with a red fox's tail."
"I will go get a red fox then."
"Have you got the red fox? Thank you for helping us. Let's try to catch the Spirit Fox together."
"Ok."
"Come. You hide there. When I lure it out, catch it! You have to be fast!"
"Little fox!"
"Ge ding. Ge ding. Ding. Ding. Ding."
"I knew it! It went to the marsh. If we don't catch it, Scooper will die!"
"Hey, don't cry."
"Have you any idea how big that marsh is? If I go there, I die...If I don't he dies..."
"Don't be like this. I will go."
"[Looking at you with misty eyes] Really? Well, get on it then!"
"...[I knew it.]"
"Would it come again if I lure it with the red tail?"
"How sly! I'll have to be careful where I step!"
"So? Did you get it?"
"Ugh, not really...[You tell Nell what happened at the marsh.]"
"It must be Lene, the old princess. She had an affair with Frey and had his baby. But that baby was killed not long after it was born..."
"Do you know who did it?"
"I...I have no authority to tell you. I need to ask for permission."
"Ugh, Scooper is down, remember?"
"There is someone else I can ask. We need to get back to the base."
"Ok."
"My child...I will avenge you, my baby!"
"It's not often somebody wanders into this place. How dare you hunt my pet? Who are you?"
"My friend got hurt. We need the fox's blood to heal him. I didn't know it had an owner. I am sorry."
"Your friend? Who cares about your friend. Can he help my baby, can he?"
"Your baby is hurt too? Maybe I can help?"
"My baby died a dozen years ago...You want to help him? You want to help him?! Ha!"
"My condolences...As you know how much it hurts to lose someone, would you be so kind as to help us?"
"Nice try. You won't get my Spirit Fox, unless you bring someone to me."
"Who?"
"Frey, the Kid. If you can bring him to me, I will give you my fox."
"[Frey? Perhaps The Inn can find him.] I might be able to do that."
"You think. He never stays in one place for long. How would you find him?"
"Do you know about The Inn? The friend I am trying to help is the Inn Council."
"The Inn? Like I would believe you! You are just trying to get my fox."
"How can I prove it to you?"
"Inn Council, you say? Must be high up. I will trade his life for an answer. I want to know who killed my baby. If you can tell me that. I will give you the fox."
"Ok."
"Bourne, tell me are you lonely there?"
"Where do you think you are going? You think you can mess with the Creed as you like? Wasn't it you that killed Seth? Haha. Don't worry. He was one of Scorpion Consul's men. I have no interest in him."
"Why are you stopping me then?"
"Because you set Karsten free! He and Ana put me in that dark cell. I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye to my Bourne! He deserves to die in the darkness!"
"It was't nice. But haven't Kerr and Karsten been through enough? What more do you want?"
"What more? The whole of Dali shall die to keep Bourne company!"
"You are crazy, lady!"
"Crazy? Yes, I am crazy. I've been crazy since Bourne died. I am only breathing now so I can avenge him. You, you need to die too!"
"Eight years. All has changed."
"Hello again."
"You! You are the Spider Consul! Didn't you say the people from the Inn were here? Where are they?"
"Ugh, haven't you figured it out yet? I was lying. I needed a distraction so I could sneak in. We'd better go. Banes will know we are here soon. Let's go get Toad Consul's daughter."
"Well, you let that go easy. Anyway I am leaving."
"Wait, Logan is the one that had the Southern Lords and their families massacred. He has Scooper and the hearer too. If you want to know what really happened, you'd better follow me."
"What? Wait!"
"Logan? But Aricia said it was Torrance! I need to know who it really was!"
"She must be Beth. She looks exactly like the Toad Consul when she was little."
"Novia, good name."
"Hey, can you tell me about Logan now?"
"I have been gathering intel on Logan for 8 years. Remember the old Jurchen lord, Deacon, that aspired to take over the south? He trained an army of deadly assassins. When he died, his brother Lord Dilan took the army and vanished with it."
"You are saying Logan is somehow connected to them?"
"Logan is the chief of this deadly army. He intends to acquire the Volume of War and reestablish the Jurchen nation. The massacre was his first big move."
"Logan...Where is he now?"
"He doesn't have much influence here, but he is Banes' trusted advisor. I have a plan to take down Banes. I need you to ask the Temple of Dragons not to interfere with Creed affairs. Then you can use their power to hunt down Logan."
"Sounds like a good plan. "
"The Creed's year long internal power struggle ended after much bloodshed. It paid a great price, though, as much of it's glory was lost in the struggle."
"The plague further stigmatized the name of the Creed."
"Novia thrived under Spider Consul's care and grew up to be a celebrated hero who led the Creed back to power."
"As the new head, she led the Creed of Five to join the Creed of Light. With the priestess' help, the Creed of Five grew in fame once again."
"Of course, we didn't know all that would happen until years later."
"Do not call me Child!"
"What are you doing in my house?"
"Little one, are you Beth?"
"What's it to you?"
"Your mom sent her to look after you."
"My mom? Ha. I have no mom. Who do you think you are trying to fool?"
"Quite a smarty pants, aren't you?"
"We must strive to better ourselves!"
"Always a pleasure to meet friends, old and new."
"I am %s. I am here to see Master Sem."
"You are %s. It was you that asked Master Healer to help Albelt? I am Albelt's friend too. Master Sem is occupied right now. But I can deliver your message."
"You know Albelt too? Good. My message...[You tell him everything.]"
"The Jurchen army is trying to take over Dali...This is very urgent. Please wait here while I report to Master Sem about this."
"I don't have much to do right now. So if you need me for anything, please just ask."
"That is so nice of you. Actually I need to take these two batches of medicine to the infected brothers. Can you help me with that?"
"Thank you."
"Of course."
"You may want to burn some wormwood to drive away any viruses you might have come in contact with, just in case."
"Yes, indeed."
"%s, the master asks for your presence."
"Great. Wait, should I bring anything?"
"Of course not."
"Are you sure? He is the old king, and one of the greatest grandmasters alive..."
"%s, really there is no need. Hey. Did you see that shadow just now?"
"Yes. It's going that way. We must chase it."
"This is...the Library? Why'd he come here? I'll ask when I stop him."
"I saw you fight. His technqiue looked quite peculiar, almost like a toad. Could he be Soren, the Western Venom?!"
"Why would Soren be here?"
"I can't say. We thought he'd disappeared after Ramona tricked him into misusing the Insight skill. How come he is back here? This is alarming!"
"Alarming?"
"Soren used to be very close with Torrance. Could it be he has recovered and is now working with Logan to restore Jurchen? In any case, the master must know about this as soon as possible. "
"Lead on."
"Go to Black Marsh."
"Go to Altar Cell"
"Too hard to make a living these days..."
"%s! What a coincidence!"
"Nomad! Just the man I was looking for!"
"That's why the Lotus Creed has been after us? But we didn't even know the Lotus Sigil was in the cargo. How did the Lotus Creed know?"
"They didn't tell me. But you can ask Rance yourself."
"[Looking embarrassed] %s, actually, we lost the cargo to a bunch of raiders."
"You were raided?"
"Yes. And we fought the raiders several times since. Oddly enough, they don't seem to want to hurt us or take the cargo anywhere. They are just holding their ground, waiting for something or someone."
"Really. Can you take me to take a look?"
"Of course. Right this way."
"Following orders...But what could be their end game plan? Who were they waiting for? And how did they know we would take this route over a month beforehand? Heavens, I didn't even know about it back then."
"We might find out more later. But if you don't want to be enemies, it's best we bring the prisoner to Rance."
"Good point. We make it a rule not to make enemies, especially the Lotus Creed. %s, I hope you can help resolve any unpleasantness we might already have caused. "
"Of course."
"You can take this one to Rance then. Please do tell him that we won't rest until we find the cargo."
"Of course. Until next time."
"It would serve us well to be careful with these raiders."
"The chief is not here. But the rest of them are quite good fighters too. We don't have enough people to beat them."
"How are they compared to me?"
"Of course none could rival you one-on-one. But they have a lot of people..."
"We won't know until we try."
"Their skills lack variation. They must be at best fighting in groups."
"Before they form a group, let's see whether we can get the cargo."
"It's not an easy living..."
"One more? Sure, why not?"
"Wait! Please don't kill me! I was just doing my job..."
"Please have mercy! I was just following orders!"
"Following orders you say?"
"Yes, yes! A month ago, someone gave me 300 Gold and asked me to raid this particular shipment from the Royal Cavaliers."
"Did you ask for what purpose?"
"I did, but he threatened to kill me! Of course, I shut up."
"And you are a raider chief."
"That doesn't mean I can throw my life away for just an answer. And the gold was right before me."
"Well, we are not finished. Come with me!"
"Why don't you come in for some tea?"
"Oh, you must have some tea before you set off again!"
"A pot of tea and some food."
"Right here. Did you come from Desert Crest? You don't know how much of a pain House Soren is! Always bullying us tradesman."
"You must be a very good tradesman to be able to stay in business."
"Haha, you flatter me. Soren has his good days, I guess. Here, please have more tea. Stay for a while longer. I will go prepare some more food for you for the road."
"That would be lovely. Thank you!"
"This is the property of the House Soren. Do not come any closer!"
"Who are you? Who does Salman think he is to bring a stranger here?"
"Don't be mad. I just came across this old man and wanted to help him carry this."
"Tell me why you came to Desert Crest! Salman is very suspicious. And you are not to be trusted either!"
"You are not making any sense."
"Am I not? This is our house! You think I am gonna trust a stranger? Sisters, get the insolent one!"
"So you can fight? I'll handle Salman first. You'd best run while you can!"
"Hold on! Is Soren here?"
"You want to meet the master? He hasn't got time for a nobody like you!"
"You might regret it, if you let me go."
"Whatever. Run or stay forever!"
"[It's best for me to go back to The Inn now.] See you."
"Send someone to follow that one. We need to lure %s back. Let the Elder Sister know the one we've been waiting for is here."
"Yes."
"Is this pass really yours?"
"Of course. Logan gave it to me."
"[Visibly relaxed] Well then, you are our honored guest. Please forgive any unpleasantness you might have experienced getting here."
"Of course. Please tell Soren I am here."
"The master has been ill. The Elder Sister is holding everything together here. She has requested your presence."
"Good for me."
"It's getting colder and colder here, since the young master left us..."
"Pleased to make your acquaintance, honored guest."
"Likewise."
"You know Logan, so I presume you are from The Occult. You really should have revealed your identity to us earlier...You know the Soren House is good at using poison..."
"You mean I've been poisoned?"
"I hope you are not mad. But we really didn't know who you were...Do you feel a sting in your stomach? I am afraid if you don't smell Cobalt Lily soon, all your skills will drain out of you..."
"[You feel a sting.] Where is the Cobalt Lily?"
"We have plenty here. It's quite a brilliant specimen. The smell of the grass poisons you. But when it blossoms at sunset, its smell cures you."
"Let me go get some then."
"It's name is vicious but it smells wonderful."
"Again, I am so sorry. By the way, what is your name?"
"[A false name for now, perhaps?] Pari."
"[Her eyes shine for a second.] So, you are Pari. How brilliantly Logan played in Dali. Quite an achievement to mess with the monks in the way he did."
"Soren was a lot of help too. Logan sent me to pay our respects for it."
"I am sure that's not all you are here for, is it?"
"No. It's not. Logan asked me to talk to Soren in person regarding an important matter."
"I need her to bring me to Soren. But if he's really recovered..."
"The master has not been himself ever since the Insight incident. All matters of the Soren House are handled by me now. You can talk to me about it."
"I will not disobey Logan's orders. I will talk only to Soren himself."
"You don't trust me? No matter. I will bring you to the master then. He is caring for the young master's tomb."
"So I can talk to him?"
"You certainly can try talking to him. Whether he is responsive to what you say is entirely a matter of your luck and his mood."
"Thank you."
"After lighting three sticks of incense, Soren looked sad. He turns his eyes and stares at you. His eyes betray a great lucidness, not at all those of a madman."
"%s, you are smart. Don't be foolish this time."
"Who would have thought there would be traitors in the Soren House too."
"Traitor? Traitor to whom? My master cut these Jurchen off long ago. And this is not even my master! They want the House Soren, but I will give them nothing!"
"He is not Soren? [Then he must be...!]"
"%s, you look ill. But why? Is that because you finally figured out who this man could be? Your mortal enemy, Logan?"
"No need to talk funny. I will have him pay, sooner or later."
"All is lost. There is only me left to fight for the whole of Jurchen. How funny!"
"Don't waste your time talking!"
"Logan (TBC)"
"Brilliant! Brilliant!"
"Where is the cure? Give me the cure!"
"Don't be in such a hurry. %s, you killed Logan. You should celebrate it. Someone knew you would avenge your family here and already laid out a feast for you in the house."
"Who? What does me avenging my family have to do with any of you?"
"Don't be so harsh. Remember you need your skills...Come, let's have a good feast, eh? Scooper is coming too."
"What are you plotting this time?"
"%s! Know your place and behave!"
"%s, if you don't behave, I won't be able to help you, understand?"
"Your master is Soren, one of the greatest grandmasters! And you do this with the Mongols!"
"So what? I get to live, which is more than I can say for you now. Blood Thorn and Cobalt Lily together, oh my!"
"Give me the cure! You know I can easily kill you right now!"
"But who else knows where the cure is, I wonder. I can go with you, no problem, if you want to. haha."
"Please take me to the medicine room then!"
"...But Carla had me collect the Blood Thorns. Is she one of them?"
"You killed Lord Basim!"
"And?"
"The Mongols won't ever let this go! You can't go! I will turn you in to the Mongols. That way we might live. "
"Oops, sorry no can do."
"Help! Stop him! Take %s! Dead or alive!"
"Snake!"
"Shaw...I will avenge you, I will. "
"Who are you? Why are you here for Shaw?"
"No, I am here for you."
"Me? For what?"
"You know for what, Soren."
"Restore Jurchen, haha. Like House Soren would work on a failed cause. He is looking for the other half of the Volume of War? I happen to be looking for it as well."
"What do you want it for?"
"If they are not working together, why does Soren want the Volume?"
"There is no book as rare as it. And I believe the Brazen skill is written in it along with the battle strategies."
"Is that so. I am afraid you can only dream about getting it though."
"Hahaha. %s, the sole heir of the Southern Lords is right here before me. Am I dreaming that too?"
"...How did you know?"
"I will tell when I have you in chains."
"Dream on!"
"Apprentices, take down this one!"
"Why do I feel so strengthless..."
"%s, you had better not try to fight it, or else all your skills will soon be gone."
"What have you done?"
"Oh, what an innocent little baby. You truly think that anything on this crest is good for you?"
"Cobalt Lily..."
"If you want to fight, by all means be my guest. I'd like to see what %s has got."
"You!"
"Isn't Scooper Occult? Can he be trusted?"
"To turn the tide, you need but one whisper."
"I am The Inn's Whisperer Carla. Pleased to make your acquaintance, %s!"
"Whisperer. It's an honor. How do you know me?"
"Not only do I know you, I also know your purpose here at Desert Crest. And I thank you for all you've done for The Inn in Dali."
"Haha, my pleasure. The Inn does look after me well too."
"You are too kind. Truth be told, I only learned of Dali because of our...disgrace there."
"It's ok. I don't need to know the details."
"Actually I think you should know, since you were somehow involved too."
"Me?"
"I presume you know who was behind the plague in Dali. Logan is not a small threat. Even worse, he has bought over one of us, the Inn Council, Scooper. They mean to kill you."
"Scooper and Logan? Kill me?"
"I don't want to believe it either. But I am afraid that's how it is. You are connected with the other half of the Volume of War, that's why Logan wants you."
"But what's in it for Scooper?"
"About that...You know The Inn's rules. No free intel. If you really want to know, you will have to trade me some Blood Thorn for it."
"Deal."
"You must already know Logan and the rest are Jurchen. Their organization is called Occult. And Logan is the leader."
"Yes, but what about Scooper?"
"If I said Scooper was also a Jurchen and has long been a member of the Occult. What would you think?"
"I would ask for proof."
"You will get your proof at House Soren. Just a piece of advice, do not trust people so easily."
"Ok. Thank you."
"Thank you for helping. But I can't burden you to stay with me. Would you mind delivering a message for me?"
"What message?"
"Do you know the Lotus Creed?"
"You mean the heathen creed?"
"Is that what you think too? They all talk about how evil we are. No matter, better to be the evil ones if they are what good is."
"So you are one of them?"
"Yes, I am the Priestess of the Persian sect. The Mongols took our base, so I led what's left of our people here to join the others. Can you please find our camp to the west and tell them I've been trapped?"
"Um...Actually..."
"She doesn't seem evil...perhaps I should help her. If she acts out, I can always take her down."
"You let that evil woman fool you so! We won't let you help her!"
"Brothers, the master is calling us back to the temple. Please come with me!"
"Brother, we'd better go see master. Let's deal with this one later."
"It's your lucky day!"
"Thank you for saving us."
"It's ok. Honestly I don't even know whether I did the right thing. I just couldn't watch a lady get bullied."
"The Lotus God shall bring a kind soul like you happiness."
"Let me escort you back to camp."
"The Priestess always takes such good care of us. We shall never let anyone hurt her."
"Who is there?"
"Hi, are you from the Persian Lotus Creed?"
"Yes, we are. Who are you? Where is she? Why did she send you? Do you have a token to prove your story?"
"There was no time for a token. She came across the western monks and got trapped farther east."
"[He looks at you in deep thought.] Ok. Take me there."
"This way."
"Wait, Damek what if it's a trap?"
"The western monks have been after us for a while. She's been gone the whole time. It is very possible that they got her."
"What if the messenger is one of them?"
"That's why I am asking you to stay while I go see what's going on. If we don't come back, you will lead our people to the Song sect."
"House Soren is tormenting us! We can't hold on much longer..."
"The desert can be so trying. Oh, water!"
"Please, gods show us mercy. We need your protection..."
"What's going on? Why were those ladies so cruel?"
"They are from the House Soren. The whole of Desert Crest belongs to them. They own us. And they don't let us forget that..."
"House Soren? [So soon.] That's where I'm headed."
"What? Why? You are so young? Why do you want to throw your life away like that?"
"No time to explain. Can you help me get in? I can help you hunt Desert Lizards."
"Ok...If you can get enough lizard skins, I will take you uphill in 10 days."
"10 days? That's not enough! We don't even have half that much now."
"They are trying to kill us..."
"Thank you, thank you!"
"It's my pleasure, really. By the way, why do they need so many lizard skins?"
"I don't really know...They kept to themselves for a while when the master went crazy. But ever since the foreigners came, the apprentices started coming downhill again."
"Foreigners? Could you tell from where?"
"Umm...I think they are from the north. But I've never really seen one before. Why don't you go to the Inn in the oasis for a few days? When we finish processing these skins, I will take you to the house."
"Ok, then. Thank you."
"You are here! Come."
"The skins are ready?"
"Yes. We had to work day and night for it. Thanks to you, we can survive another day!"
"Thank you for taking me."
"House Soren doesn't like strangers. You can carry some skins up. And when we get there, remember to keep quiet."
"Ok, got it. I won't cause you any trouble."
"It's ok. Just that the women are not ones to be messed with.."
"Hey, look at that! Salman, you kept your word! You wouldn't be so stupid as to try to fool us, would you?"
"Of course not. These are all great skins. Perfect for making armor."
"Eh? Who told you we are going to use them for armor?"
"That...I..."
"The gods have forsaken us!"
"I, Logan did everything I could for Jurchen. I thought about every turn and twist, but never could I imagine losing like this. The gods want Jurchen gone! There is no hope for us!"
"You shouldn't have wasted your talent."
"%s, you shut up! The Mongols are coming for you and you stand here mocking me! What did you think would happen? You think Song can enjoy peace, just because we are gone?"
"If Jurchen was not busy invading us, it might've stood a chance."
"Enough, there are only winners and losers. Today it's me. Tomorrow it will be you! I'd love to see how you, %s hold the tide alone!"
"One lives to defend his country."
"One lives to defend his country'. haha!"
"Your king is an absolute train wreck. Why do you serve him? The world is soon to be ours!"
"I am not feeling well. I really should excuse myself from the table."
"The Inn sees all. I say you should stay..."
"I can only follow Ezra's orders as what to see and what not. Lady, do spare a poor soul."
"Ok then. We shall invite Ezra along next time."
"What is Scooper doing? To leave here and run? What a friend!"
"%s, we really respect your talent and we see a great future for you with us! Join us! We are the future!"
"Sorry, your future is certainly not mine."
"You want to do this the hard way then?"
"I won't do it."
"We will see about that! Whom I can't have, I kill!"
"See if you can!"
"Final Orders (TBC)"
"Lord Basim! I will go get help now!"
"Basim is gone. We can't stay here!"
"In this world, no one can stay out of trouble."
"This Soren is not the real Soren. Soren died on Mount Hua before you met Albelt. This man prentended to be Soren to pick a fight. He is up to something."
"Hold on. Soren is dead?"
"Yes. Kellye and I escaped from the Occult and went to River Town. I met Albelt there and he told me that Soren, the Western Venom, and the Northern Beggar were both killed at Mount Hua."
"Why did you come here?"
"Gage was at River Town. He told me what happened at Dali, and we realized this Soren was a fake, so..."
"Who is there?"
"%s, over here!"
"Scooper? He waited for me..."
"Do you still think I am a mole?"
"...I don't know what to think now."
"Whatever. Let's get downhill first. It's not safe here."
"You got out of the feast, why didn't you leave?"
"I still have things to do here."
"This is not the place to talk. Let's get through here first."
"A Mongol Lord died at House Soren. Farica and the others won't rest until they've got you."
"I am already used to having someone after me."
"%s, even though Logan is dead, the realm still needs you. I hope you don't lose sight of what's important now that your revenge is complete."
"Since when did you learn to be so wise?"
"Stop making fun of me. I am wounded. You are still recovering from the poison. We should rest a little at that tea house there."
"Good idea."
"%s, you are awake! I am wounded. I can't hold them for long. You'll need to join the fight soon."
"I am coming."
"Listen, we are probably surrounded by Carla's people. It would be tough for us to break through now. Let's pretend to try to break through, while looking for a chance to get to the lake near House Soren."
"But the Mongols are there!"
"There is a secret passage below the lake. I have people there. Once we are in, we have a chance of shaking them."
"Why didn't you say so before then?"
"Sorry, I needed to do this to lure the mole out."
"Ah, don't you always?"
"%s, no time to kid. Let's go!"
"By all means!"
"How powerful House Soren was! Now Soren is gone. And the house has declined too. How fate plays with us."
"Seriously, you have time for this?"
"Right, the passage is at the bottom. Come."
"But the enemy is too close."
"Leave them be. I can deal with them once we are in."
"...[I hope you really can this time.]"
"Oh, finally, air!"
"You are going back to River Town?"
"Yes. %s, why don't you come with me and let The Inn reward you for what you've done for us."
"Thank you for offering. But I don't want to go back to River Town just yet."
"To be honest, I need to spend some time alone."
"Oh, ok. I understand, you must need time to decipher your feelings and decide your future. I need to bring Carla to Ezra now. %s, until next time."
"Until next time."
"I've never felt so lost. What do I do now?"
"The exit is straight ahead. We will go our separate ways there. I need to bring Carla back to Ezra."
"You and Kellye alone? Also you have no way to know where Carla could be hiding now."
"You are so stubborn! But I do admire your stubbornness."
"Scooper, what do you plan to do?"
"Carla has long gone rogue. She's done wrong to the realm. The Inn won't spare her. My wounds will slow me down. Can you help me do it?"
"I was there when the massacre happened. We should never have missed you! Karma...This is karma."
"Out of the frying pan into the fire. What have I done to deserve this?"
"Council! %s!"
"Hello again."
"Thank heavens. I was so worried. Wait, you've been followed! Did you not bother to shake them before you came in?"
"Ugh, no."
"You are lucky I prepared for this. There is a mechanism. Once I activate it, the entrance will shut."
"Thank heavens, we have you! Let me activate it. You guys go ahead. "
"Careful, Council."
"I will be fine. Lead on."
"You ignorant little...We are doing the gods' work!"
"Get out of our way!"
"All I see is two old men bullying a little girl! You should be ashamed of yourselves!"
"What do you know? This is the Persian heathen creed's priestess. She can't get into the realm!"
"...[Ugh, not again!]"
"What are you doing? Serve your realm!"
"But still, she is but a girl."
"The Song sect promised to send their best to help and protect us. I came out to meet their contact."
"But where is the contact?"
"We were going to meet in an abandoned market up north. But these two monks stopped me on the way and cornered me. Could you be so kind to help me with something?"
"You want me to help you meet the contact?"
"Yes, if you could. I am too obvious a target. It  would be best to have the contact meet us here. "
"Of course."
"%s, what's wrong?"
"Gather your people and come with me!"
"With you? But where? What happened?"
"The Song sect is fighting the Mongols. Let me take you to River Town. It's safer there. "
"What? Mongols? They chased us here?"
"No time to talk about it now. Let's get on the road."
"I will not go back to Lotus Peak without the sigil!"
"We would have, but the timing is too unfortunate. We really don't have time to take care of her right now. We've just got leads on the Lotus Sigil. We must find it first."
"But Elysia and her people are in danger. The western monks are after them."
"Didn't you say they were called back? Just go and tell her I will come for her once we take back the sigil. Otherwise she needs to think of something else."
"This is how you treat your own?"
"You'd better think before you start throwing accusations around."
"You'd better think about what you are doing."
"Mind your own business, or I will teach you to!"
"Wait! You, come let's have a chat."
"From the way you fight...Do you know the Killer Doctor, Sal?"
"[This is a surprise.] Sal? He watched me grow up."
"Haha. You are one of us then. Sal is one of my best friends. A friend of his is a friend of mine."
"[What a turn of events.] Um, about the Persian sect then?"
"It's not that I don't want to help. It's really that the sigil means far too much for us to abandon the chance to retrieve it. I have to get it back."
"I understand now. How's the search going?"
"We heard it's hidden in cargo escorted by the Royal Cavalier. But we don't know where it came from and where it is going to."
"Then how far are you on the search?"
"I got in over my head and confronted the Royal Cavalier about it. Now they have put up heavy defenses against us."
"I am friends with the Royal Cavalier's warden, Nomad. Perhaps I can help."
"That would be great! Any information on the sigil will be much appreciated!"
"Let me see what I can do."
"What is Nomad playing at, bringing this man here?"
"He thinks it's best to let you question him."
"I'd like to find out who is behind this. %s, want to question him with me?"
"Happy to."
"Ah! I told you everything I know!"
"I was only acting on orders, I swear! Other than that I know nothing."
"Please stop hitting me! I really don't know anything more."
"I only knew to raid Royal Cavalier's cargo in a month. I don't even know what a Lotus Sigil is! Ah!"
"Please stop! I will talk! I will talk!"
"Haha! That was a good scratching! Brothers, show yourselves!"
"No! Mongols! It's a setup! Brothers, gear up!"
"Gear up!"
"Slay the heathens!"
"Come on!"
"The Mongols set us up!"
"Rance, what now?"
"The only thing we can do now, fight! %s, go find the Persians. They Mongols must have followed them here hoping to slay us all. Only in their dreams!"
"But there are so many of them. Will you be okay?"
"I will do better than ok! Go take the Persians to River Town. You are more welcome there than I am. They are in your charge from now on!"
"I won't disappoint you, Rance."
"Go to Raider Camp"
"Go to Shaw's Grave."
"Go to Medicine Room."
"They are too close! Come, follow me to the passage!"
"Go to Secret Path"
"No one shall cause a scene in Desert Crest!"
"U Turn (TBC)"
"Talk to my sword!"
"Please!"
"Taoist school...in trouble..."
"Thank you for saving my life..."
"Your wound is bad. Let me take you out of here."
"Did you see my brothers?"
"Yes, they left already."
"Good. Good. The Mongols are such savages. We only asked them to take off their weapons before they go uphill, and they started hitting us and wrecked the Guest Arbor."
"They were going to the peak?"
"These people fight like the raiders in Desert Crest. Could be they shifted their focus to Cyrus Palace?"
"Nothing...but maybe I can find something for Rance since they're here."
"Something on your mind?"
"Did any other Mongols go uphill, besides these ones?"
"Yes. There were a lot of them. Soldiers. The masters are meditating. The brothers uphill might not be able to fight the Mongols off. Can you help us?"
"The Mongols would dare to mess with the Taoist school..."
"Please...please help us gather more people to go uphill."
"I will. Take this medicine."
"Fate, it plays with us."
"You are...%s? You've grown up well. I almost didn't recognize you!"
"Albelt, your arm! How?"
"[He glances at his sleeve.] Long story. I will tell you when we have more time. Where have you been all these years? Thank you for sending Master Healer. I wouldn't have lived this long if not for you."
"It's my pleasure, Albelt. Gage would have asked him to cure your poison too, if I hadn't gotten there first."
"My poison is not...No matter. You are going to Cyrus Palace? I was going to the tomb, but then I heard fighting in the palace. So I came to check on it."
"The Mongols are here to honor the Taoist school. Must be chaos."
"The Seven Immortals will never allow that! Come, let's go see."
"Gold Kanet!"
"Albelt, Adrial, who is that?"
"He is a high council in the Mongol court. He wanders around the realm to recruit for Lord Naxos. We've met a couple of times."
"I see."
"His skills would rank among the grandmasters, and yet he has such a despicable nature."
"Let me handle him."
"Adrial..."
"Albelt, I am so cold..."
"No! Your arm..."
"My arm...was hacked off..."
"But who? Who dares hurt you so?"
"I will tell you when we are alone..."
"The Seven Immortals should keep Garrison in check. Well done, %s."
"As long as it works."
"Adrial needs a quiet place to heal. Can you help?"
"Of course. You get her out of here. I will hold it here."
"No matter what, Adrial is still my Adrial. Payton does not matter. "
"Indeed."
"I don't want to waste anymore time here with these hypocrites. It's not good for Adrial. I am going to take her back to the tomb."
"Go ahead."
"What are you doing?"
"They really don't give up!"
"That ding weighs at least two hundred pounds. It should hold for a while. %s, your power has grown! You could probably beat me now."
"You are too kind.That would only happen in my dreams."
"%s, you have supported us from day one. Now that we are getting married, would you like to be our witness?"
"Of course! If I may be so honored!"
"Great! In the whole world, how many can understand us like you..."
"One is enough, isn't it. Cheer up. This is a good day!"
"We should really throw you a feast. But I am afraid we might have to skip that here."
"Haha. Let's drink on it another day!"
"No, not another day. Would you mind coming to the Immortals Tomb with us? Let's drink at home where nobody objects to our union."
"The Immortals Tomb? Of course! It must be quite a sight."
"What about you stay with us for a while there? We should really like to have a friend with us."
"Of course I can stay."
"The Taoist school stands tall and mighty in the realm. %s, you had better not fight them for long. Let me take over."
"No. You have Adrial to take care of."
"We need a distraction if we want to get out of here unscathed..."
"Hush. Albelt, do you hear that?"
"It is wasps? Sounds like there are many of them..."
"Yes. And they are getting closer. Albelt, this is our distraction!"
"The gate is blocked. We need to get in through the water. I can take Adrial in in a box."
"You go ahead then. Frey is coming. I need to get rid of him first."
"Right, Adrial just told me there is one thing that might help you do that.  He is quite obsessed with wasps these days. He brought the wasps to the temple."
"No wonder they call him The Kid...But I do admire how he is always having fun."
"This Wasp Honey will keep him busy for a while. Give it to him, and you can sneak away."
"Thank you, Albelt."
"%s, I am going to prepare a feast at the tomb. Come when you are done!"
"Oh..."
"Thank you! Adrial is saved now."
"It's my pleasure."
"Lilas won't come back anytime soon. Would you like to stay with us? Once Adrial has recovered we can have that drink."
"Albelt, I think it's best if I leave you lovebirds alone. I'm happy enough to have witnessed your wedding and seen your home."
"Do you really not want to stay?"
"Another time? When Adrial is better?"
"Ok then. %s, remember you always have a friend here."
"Thank you, Albelt. Until next time."
"I love Albelt. And he loves me. Why can't they understand? Why won't they let us be together?"
"Won't they laugh at my Albelt? To be with me, damaged as I am?"
"Why? They should be envious of your love."
"I just want to go back to the tomb with him and never come out again...I never want to see..."
"You are so innocent and I've never met someone as wild and free as Albelt. The world is not good enough for you."
"Why won't they let us be together? He is more powerful than I am now. He is not my apprentice anymore. Why can't I be his wife?"
"Really, you don't need to worry about what they think."
"Albelt! You animal! She is your master! Let me go!"
"Nobody shall stand in my way! I want my fortune!"
"Useless scum! Who are you?"
"I am %s. Garrison, why not fight me yourself?"
"You are the Southern Lords' sole heir - %s? You didn't die at Desert Crest?"
"No, I didn't. Sorry to disappoint you."
"The Inn talked you up! Everybody knows your name now. I don't see what the fuss is about!"
"I don't see how a Taoist would  follow the Mongols either."
"The Mongols are gone! Why are you still here?"
"Where is your bravery now?"
"%s, Albelt is but a pupil cast out of our school. Now he is in love with his own master. What a disgrace! You would do well not to mingle with an animal like that!"
"Albelt and Adrial are no longer master and apprentice. Why can't they love each other? He is an animal? You betrayed your own school and country!"
"How dare you! I will spare you this one time for your lineage's sake! Leave now or never!"
"I wonder whether you would still be this bossy if the Seven Immortals were here?"
"What are you planning? Come on! Take down %s! Hurry!"
"You think stopping the Seven Immortals from coming out makes you the boss? It's not that easy!"
"These seven should be ashamed of themselves for you! The Taoist Master is turning in his grave!"
"Let me remove the wool from your eyes so you can see the truth!"
"Do you know what you are doing? I am the new head of the Taoist school! You fight against me, you fight against the entire school!"
"Really? Let's see what the Seven Immortals are going to say about that!"
"You! %s, wait. I was confused. I thought I was doing the right thing for the school!"
"Oh? That's not what you said in front of Gold Kanet."
"But I only said those things to fool him. I was only playing along. I was going to fight the Mongols with Albelt after the ceremony."
"I think you now are trying to play me. And I think you should save your breath."
"Buzz buzz."
"This is a blessed land. Rising stars everywhere."
"Where did you come from? This is between Albelt and I. You stay out of it!"
"I would if you fought fair!"
"I am here to congratulate Garrison on becoming the new head of the Taoist School and grant the school official ranking. I have no intention of fighting you."
"Absurd! You attack first and feign innocence?!"
"Garrison, you really want to have me handle this little disturbance?"
"No, of course not! I will take care of them! Pupils, send them down the peak!"
"Get back! %s is right. Losers are losers."
"But master, I...Yes, sir!"
"%s, are you really getting your hands dirty here?"
"Why not?"
"I am an old Mongol Minister. I won't fight a young nobody like you. My business is done here anyway. Farewell."
"Running away?"
"I don't need to argue with you. We will meet again. %s, next time you will pay for today's insult and Basim's death."
"Get out of here already!"
"Albelt, this is one more thing we need to sort out."
"I look forward to settling everything with you!"
"Gold Kanet! Don't go yet, Gold Kanet!"
"Um...I just remembered I have something very important to do. I should probably go do it."
"I hope you don't mind meeting me out in this wilderness."
"Out with it then."
"%s, I really admire your talent. So young and already so powerful already. Would you like to compete with me for this banner?"
"You really like playing competitive games, don't you?"
"Don't be rude. If you win I will forget about what happened in Cyrus Palace. If you lose, I take you back to Lord Naxos to answer for Basim's death. Do you dare?"
"Dare? I hope you don't regret it."
"Ok then. I will keep my end of the wager and forget about Cyrus Palace."
"And?"
"I am on a mission to defeat all masters. You are the very best of your generation. Care to fight me?"
"%s never says no to a good fight."
"Good! I have dozens of years of more practice over you, so I will only employ 50%% of my power when we fight. If you beat me, you win!"
"Let's begin!"
"This is indeed a land blessed with many talents."
"A word of advice. Don't work for the Mongols, go home and put your power to good use."
"The world will soon belong to the Mongols'. If your people can rule here, why can't the Mongols?"
"They could, if they ruled with justice and mercy. But instead they slaughter and raid. They can't be allowed to rule here."
"I care not how the world should be ruled. %s, your talents are beyond expectation. You have a promising future, why waste it in a doomed country like Koen?"
"You will never understand."
"I have heard how General Brazen and your family dedicated their lives to the country yet received nothing in return."
"But they did their best to bring peace to land for the sake of its people."
"Think however you like. It's your life."
"I've learned from this fight. Perhaps we can do it again sometime. "
"Why is there a pretty sister at the tomb gate?"
"Song is really a beautiful country. I can feel such serenity here."
"Haha. This is Hermit Peaks territory. The Taoist School is based here. No wonder you would feel so serene."
"Taoist School? The one founded by Taoist Master? Even I have heard of them."
"The Taoist Master is well known in the west too?"
"Of course. It's such a pity that he passed. It would be such an honor to meet him in person."
"His pupils, the Seven Immortals are still up there. It's getting late. Let's find a shelter to rest."
"Are you vexed because of me?"
"The Mongols invaded us and now they are here too. Of course I understand how you feel. I was planning to go to Lotus Peak on my own in any case. Thank you for accompanying this far."
"But I promised to take you there myself..."
"But you have more important things to do now. The Taoist School needs you more than I do. %s, let's say farewell here and now. When I get to Lotus Peak, I will send you letters."
"I owe you one. If there is anything you need me for in the future, just let me know."
"%s, you've been so kind! Farewell."
"That man really looks like Albelt...It is him!"
"Go to Immortals Tomb."
"Go to Tomb Cell."
"Go to Tomb Passage"
"I am the Mongol Prince. I won't lower myself to your level!"
"Garrison, I have something to say."
"You are %s? Did you kill Basim?"
"Yes. I did. And you are?"
"I am Holden, the Mongol Prince. I heard what happened in Desert Crest. Basim was crude. I apologize for him. But our Lord Naxos is a great man. I am sure you will get along really well."
"I don't want to get along with him."
"I gave you a chance and you spurned it! Fine then. Show me how great and powerful you really are! For Basim!"
"Let's see what your highness has got then."
"Perhaps I haven't practiced enough to match your skills. I may have lost this one but I will win next time."
"A loss is a loss. "
"You! Take that back!"
"Or you will fight me again?"
"%s, come let's have a chat."
"Holden? Let's see what he is after."
"%s, really. I am not going to try anything funny."
"What do you want?"
"I told Lord Naxos about how great you were at Cyrus Palace and he was really impressed, %s. He wants to meet you in person."
"Ok. Right after I finish my friend's wedding feast, okay?"
"%s, the most prominent lord in all of Mongol is asking to meet you in person. Do you not see how much of an honor this is?"
"Not as much as being invited to my friend's wedding?"
"%s, you are so funny. But my men don't really have a sense of humor."
"This is what you are really after, isn't it?"
"Nice! Great skills!"
"Thank you."
"%s, my master is right over there. Please come meet him."
"I knew it."
"She found a good man. How lucky."
"Are you going in the tomb?"
"Yes. You too?"
"This is already Immortals Tomb territory. We need protection to go forward."
"Really?"
"The woods are filled with wasps raised by the Tomb School. One sting can easily kill. But...why do you smell like wasp honey?"
"Oh, I handled it once."
"[Looking at you closely] That will help. The wasps will go easy on you. Put this veil on the honeycomb, and we will be fine."
"Ok."
"Thank you. The master only taught my sister how to raise wasps. She was always the favorite."
"Adrial is your sister? So you are the Red Raider, Lilas?"
"Haha. I am impressed. You know Adrial...Do you know Albelt too?"
"Yes, I know him too. Are you here for their wedding feast too?"
"Wedding feast? How lovely. But I didn't bring any presents...How rude of me, haha."
"[She sounds sarcastic. She is not their friend?]"
"What are you thinking? You are here for the feast, you must know how to get in?"
"I know to get in through water. But I don't know where exactly."
"Don't worry. Let's figure it out together."
"Come on, I mean no harm. I can't swim. Can you find me something to cross in? Then I can lead you in."
"Ok then."
"She doesn't seem like a friend. Tread lightly."
"Gourd?"
"The air in it should be enough for you."
"Swarms of wasps block our path. Please be careful."
"I will."
"I don't know how to keep the wasps away. So you are on your own."
"Ok."
"Were you stung?"
"No. How far is the entrance?"
"This is it. The river flows through the tomb. I will lead the way. Follow me closely."
"Ok."
"Impressive! You found your way here, haha!"
"Lilas, how could you attack us like that?"
"I will do anything to get the Tomb Volume. The master was so biased. She gave it to Adrial. Big surprise...But today it will be mine."
"Adrial is wounded. You should really come visit another day."
"When she has healed? I didn't come here to borrow it! Tell me where the Tomb Volume is or I will make sure she never recovers!"
"Don't be so cruel!"
"Mind your own business! Your nosiness annoys me. "
"Albelt is my friend. Of course this is my business."
"%s, you asked for this then. I will kill you first, then I will handle them. "
"See if you can!"
"You! How come it did not work?"
"I've met the Creed of Five. They gave me a little gift."
"You! This is not a good time. Sister, just so you know. I won't rest until I get it."
"Your power is already great. Why can't you just let it go?"
"What else do I have other than my own power? Men? Ha! I need more power, so I can slay all the unfaithful men in the world!  What would you know?"
"How love changes you..."
"Adrial, I am so sorry!"
"You are still so annoying!"
"Why are you here? Was that Lilas? How come you were with her? Hey! I am talking to you!"
"Slow down, okay?"
"Whatever! We came to look for my sister. Albelt took her away again."
"He must have his reasons. Do you know what happened to his arm?"
"...What? You're here about that? It's not like I meant to do it! Dad punished me for it already...I didn't mean to do it. It's not my fault!"
"You hacked off his arm! You!"
"That Rihane! If I never see her again it'll be too soon! Eh? Is that a baby crying?"
"This wall's hollow. Let me try to break it."
"It's through!"
"Let's go to the other side."
"It's Ria! Ria, it's me, Rihane. Are you okay?..."
"If not for the crying, we would have been stuck in the cell forever."
"I need to find a way to get rid of them before I go see Albelt and Adrial."
"Hey!"
"Your highness, I have a name."
"Whatever. My parents are holding the Beggar's Convention. They are going to elect the new Chief Beggar. Do you want to come? I can introduce you to a lot of important people."
"No, thank you."
"This is the second time you've turned me down! If you don't come, I will have dad write an invitation himself. Then you'll have to come!"
"You haven't changed a bit."
"Beggar's Convention. Perhaps I'll go, despite Rihane."
"Good. You are doing the right thing."
"I just don't want to have you nagging me about it."
"Whatever. Come to the forest next month, before the 16th. It will be good fun."
"Ok, then, your highness."
"I used the honey I stole from Adrial. Why are the wasps still stinging!"
"Ah! Don't chase me! Don't chase me! The wasps are chasing you!"
"Get out of my way! Ouch!"
"They are gone. They are gone...Phew. %s, what are you doing here with this bunch of losers?"
"You definitely know how to make an entrance!"
"Haha. Come, tell me why you're here. You knew I would come? So you came to wait for me?"
"No...I came with Albelt."
"Albelt! He is here? Why didn't he say hi? So mean! Where is he? Let me beat his ass."
"Um...Albelt was just here..."
"Where is he now? Where did he go?"
"Now to get rid of Frey and the pupils..."
"What? Gone?"
"Albelt and Adrial just got married today. They want to spend some time  alone."
"What? They got married? Why would any man want to get married!"
"Not everyone is like you."
"Adrial is a good girl though. He did well. Ha."
"Frey, I bet you can't shake those pupils. Do you want to bet on it? I will take you to the wedding feast if you win."
"You are kidding me. I can't shake them? Listen, I have something very important to discuss with %s. Do not follow me!"
"Hey, %s, wait for me!"
"Eh? Honey. Adrial must have known I'm out, so she made me a new bottle! She's nice. Buzz, buzz, here wasps!"
"It's not all for you. The pupils need it to cure their stings."
"Ah? But this is not enough! If I share it, I'll have nothing left!"
"Those are your apprentices' apprentices..."
"Albelt should have given me more. So cheap, that one. This is not enough..."
"Hey, I don't think he is the cheap one around here."
"Ah! Ok, ok! I will give it to them!  Wait for me here. I will go visit Albelt with you so I can get more."
"Ok, I will wait for you. [Like hell I will...]"
"Promise!"
"I am getting out of here..."
"Phew, finally. Now I can go see Albelt and Adrial."
"Go to Taoist Temple."
"Cyrus Palace...under attack..."
"Mongols? No, these pupils can't fight them!"
"Help us..."
"Some of our brothers have been taken by the Mongols. Please save them..."
"Where are they?"
"Behind the Guest Arbor. Please hurry."
"Ok. Wait here."
"Master Cyrus must be so disappointed in us!"
"%s, I can't believe you agree with what Albelt and Adrial are doing."
"I don't think there is anything wrong with two consenting adults being in love."
"Young people these days. What has the world come to? Have you forgotton your ancestors and your four masters' teachings? Well, Albelt was one of us. I have to discipline him. I don't care what you do. Just stay out of this."
"Today is Albelt's wedding day. I shall not let you ruin it."
"You are sure about this?"
"I respect you as a master, but Albelt is my friend. I won't stand by and do nothing."
"Then I will have to go through you."
"Forgive me."
"Dragon Gate (TBC)"
"We are lucky fire drove the wasps away, or else...Master Frey is always half mad like this. Where did he get the wasps?"
"These are not just any wasps, these are Tomb School's wasps."
"What? Those are highly poisonous. We have so many stung pupils! What now?"
"Frey is very childish. But he is your elder. There's really nothing you can do about it."
"%s, please don't mock us. You are friends with Albelt, can you get some of Adrial's Wasp Honey? It's the only thing that can save my pupils."
"Let me stop Frey first."
"Home Visit (TBC)"
"Pupils! Surround the temple! Do not let Albelt get away!"
" I, %s won't let you do this!"
"Rihane, do try to be nice..."
"We've found Ria. We've got what we wanted. %s, come with us. We'll find a way out."
"No, thank you."
"I know you don't like Rihane. She is a bit too...spoiled. But we are all stuck here. It would be best for everyone if we stick together. Or, do you already know how to get out?"
"I am not planning on leaving yet."
"No? You want to stay here and fight the Red Raider? Why did the two of you come here together?"
"I came to see Albelt and Adrial."
"So Albelt is here...No, we have to keep him away from Rihane."
"Right. So don't follow me."
"Hey, where are you going?"
"We have no idea how to get out. We should follow %s and look for an exit. Then we can leave. "
"%s, wait! We want to come with you!"
"...[What a headache!]"
"Don't worry. Once we find an exit, we won't bother you anymore. Also we will keep Rihane away from Albelt."
"I'd rather have her apologize to Ablert."
"[Looking alerted.] What happened between them is their business. You'd better stay out of it."
"Rest assured. I won't let her ruin Albelt's wedding day."
"Wedding day? What wedding? Ah! The stone figure is coming to life!"
"No, those are the Undead Soldiers! Watch out!"
"I knew Taoist Master would have heavy defenses. "
"There is a Stone Lamp. Let me light it and see."
"[It takes a while for the light to become strong enough.]"
"What are these holes?"
"[The holes on the ground shine bright.]"
"It's a setup!"
"A wall? There must be...maybe that Stone Crane?"
"[An out-of-place stone crane in front of a dead end...It's too obvious.]"
"Could it be another trigger?"
"[You circle the crane checking for a trigger and check the wall behind it. It sounds hollow and thick.]"
"The crane has been turned recently..."
"We are Beggars yes. But our school is the largest in the realm. We are inviting many prominent guests for this convention. Let's take the best care of them that we can."
"Welcome. Welcome. Your invitation please."
"Here."
"Oh? This is a fake. Where did you get it?"
"Fake? How? Rihane gave it to me herself."
"But Ramona has never asked her to give out invitations. How could she have given it to you? You're lying."
"I am not. Really! [That spoiled little...! ]"
"But it definitely is a fake. Why would you go through so much trouble to come to the convention..."
"It's fine. I don't need to go in."
"Wait. There must be a misunderstanding. Let me apologize in Chief Ramona's presence."
"You want to take me down? Don't you!"
"No need to get angry. I am but a poor Beggar, but Beggars don't stomach insults."
"I am not insulting you. You are accusing me!"
"Was it not you that came here with a fake invitation and lied about getting it from Rihane?"
"There is just no getting through to you. What do you want?"
"Let's go see Chief Ramona. She will know who is in the wrong."
"Don't say I didn't warn you."
"Come along. Fighting a Beggar in this forest is really not that smart. In the end you have to do what I say, see?"
"Why are the heathens here? To show up here, in front of all our prominent guests. How dare they!"
"They can go wherever they want to."
"You know nothing. We are the righteous. They are heathens. We don't mix."
"Anyway, where is the convention at exactly?"
"And you say Rihane invited you herself...Of course we are meeting at the Beggar Temple!"
"Beggar Temple. Got it."
"Ouch! You little..."
"Sorry, perhaps it's time you take a nap. Rihane, see if I spare you!"
"That should do it. What else? Right, your cane, little Beggar."
"Authorized access only!"
"Take the newcomer to see Regan."
"Hey, I'm just passing by. No need to be so nervous..."
"Do not spare any of these Beggars!"
"What? When did the Beggars get in trouble with Lotus Creed?"
"Shut up. Let's go see the elder."
"What if I don't want to?"
"This is a chance to see what the Lotus Creed's after."
"Those with closed minds call us heathens. But names mean little."
"Ramona sent you to spy on us?"
"I don't know what you are talking about. I was just taking a walk."
"Taking a walk? All your brothers and sisters are busy running around for the convention, and you have time for a walk?"
"You've just got to make the time, you know..."
"You go back and tell Ramona to return what doesn't belong to her. Or else trouble is going to come knocking."
"What did she take that is yours?"
"She knows."
"So, can I go now?"
"You heard the man. Someone wants to see you. You have to stay for a while longer."
"Who is that?"
"Just follow me."
"… [I'll go take a look.]"
"Regan of the Lotus Creed here to meet with Chief Ramona. We request that you return the Lotus Sigil to us."
"Lotus Sigil! [So that is what he was talking about.]"
"No, my friend. We might not equal Beggar Sect in fame, but we are not so clueless either. We know where our sigil is."
"[He doesn't know I am the little Beggar.] But last time you thought you found the sigil in Desert Crest it turned out to be a setup. "
"...Who are you? How do you know this?"
"I met one of your own at Desert Crest. So how is Rance?"
"You are...%s?"
"You know about me?"
"Rance talked about what happened in Desert Crest. You're a  friend, but I fear I must tell you that this cannot be solved with a few friendly words."
"I understand. I just hope you will stop and consider the gravity of things."
"The Beggars took our Lotus Sigil. There is no doubt in that. I'd like to ask if Ramona thought about the gravity of things when she took our most treasured token."
"What proof do you have that the Beggar school has it?"
"You should remember the Royal Cavalier that took the deal. Do you think they would let it go without getting to the bottom of it?"
"So?"
"Rance and Nomad defeated the Mongols in the desert. And with Royal Cavalier's help, he discovered the cargo was from the Beggar Sect!"
"Isn't it a little too rash to accuse the Beggar Sect of having the sigil just because the cargo was from them?"
"%s, whether they have it or not, I need Ramona to come clean with me. I advise you not to interfere."
"I can't have them at each other's throats."
"Green Waves is a maze but they'll find me."
"Still nothing...Let's try with some smoke then."
"Why didn't Ramona come?"
"She sent me to lead the way."
"The plan was to get Ramona here. But you will do as well. Perhaps it is better if you act as a middleman."
"I don't understand..."
"I know she is waiting for your signal to come. Let me brief you then."
"So there is a plan..."
"Yes. I needed to get everyone here without setting off the Mongols' alarm."
"So you know Gold Kanet is here."
"Of course. We've been checking their every move. The second he stepped foot in the temple, I knew. That saved me some trouble. I need him here."
"By the way, can you delegate some of this to Ramona or do you plan to run back and forth yourself?"
"Right, let me give her the signal."
"No, ambush!"
"Regan, what is this for?"
"Ramona, please this is not our doing. If we wanted you harmed, you wouldn't be able to walk out of Green Waves."
"Whether or not. Let's settle it after this!"
"Why do they remind me of..."
"What are you thinking, Regan?"
"[Sighing.] No, it's not possible. %s, can you do me a favor?"
"Please."
"Can you take out the Rising Dead's hearts for me to examine? If they were who I suspect they are, things will get worse very fast..."
"Ok, wait."
"He looks serious. I hope everything will be fine."
"Please give the hearts to me."
"Regan, something is moving inside their hearts..."
"It is? So it is the Heart Worm then. But how did they get here..."
"Heart Worm? What is that?"
"It is a taboo skill. The worms take ten years to mature but once implanted into a person, they turn the host  into a powerful beast whose only thought is to kill. Eventually even the worm breeder will lose control of them."
"The Creed of Five is in the Far South. This is the north..."
"The Sweeper is working, but there is still a risk."
"What now?"
"Banes has no support now. Why would he set up Beggar Sect and Lotus Creed here? Also where did he find the resources to breed so many heart worms?"
"So someone is behind this."
"First the Mongols, now Banes. They must be connected. If the Mongols get their hands on the Heart Worm trick..."
"Banes was working with the Occult before. I wouldn't be surprised if he joined the Mongols now."
"%s, we need to take action now. Ramona and I will go gather our people. You and Lorsa follow this lead and find Banes."
"Ok. We will leave tracking marks. Come as soon as possible."
"Banes must be crazy! Ramona and I went to meet Kane, and we found Mongols troops heading deep into Green Waves. Ramona and the others went to check."
"So Banes did join the Mongols."
"What a disgrace he is to us all!"
"… [So he still considers himself from the Far South.]"
"%s, why are you looking at me like that? He is the Creed of Five's traitor. Lorsa should decide what to do with him. I don't know what to say to her...Could you go ask what she wants to do with him?"
"Lorsa..."
"Why don't you go back South with her?"
"As she said we all have our own paths. I am already a Lotusee. And she is the Creed of Five's new Enforcer. Head of her clan. The less she has to worry about, the better..."
"How did you come into this situation?"
"I spent years in Song. I can't just leave. The South is my home but it's filled with heartbreak. The Lotus Creed is fighting the Mongols now. I can't run away from that. When I can, I will go visit her."
"Ok."
"Banes is down. Now it's the Mongols' turn. The Beggars are in Green Waves. We must get there now."
"Let's go."
"Looks like the Mongols are retreating. Did you succeed?"
"Gold Kanet promised never to set foot in Song again as long as I am here."
"Good! Without him, the Mongols are that much weaker to us. Taking out the generals will be much easier."
"Is the Lotus Creed planning something?"
"Yes. The Mongols overran our Persian base, and murdered many of us. We will not let them continue to maraud about our realm. Our king may be weak, but we shall be strong! We will organize an army against them."
"They shame you as the heathens. But you are the one that shames them..."
"It doesn't matter. Heathens have less things to worry about. I call it a good thing, eh?"
"Haha. I guess it does have its perks."
"Do not ask who I am. I am one of you, that's all you need to know."
"Sorry. I am so embarrassed."
"Ha. Don't be. You said your family is connected with the Beggars?"
"Yes. The story is...more interesting when talked about at the chess table. Care for a match?"
"Ugh, I am just a Beggar. I don't know how to play."
"No matter. You can learn as you play."
"Ok then."
"You're right. Trawet was my grandfather."
"Then your grandmother was the Tangut princess. Doesn't that make you a Tangut prince?"
"Tangut is long gone. How can a Tangut prince still exist? I am nobody now."
"As you wish."
"The Lotus Creed believes it was the Beggars that took the sigil. They are planning on taking it back. You must go back and deliver this message to Ramona. Sorry, if I've delayed you."
"I will."
"The Beggar Sect? But they are not enemies."
"Sia...Sia! Silly silly girl!"
"Lorsa left this. Help Sia take it."
"Sia! Sia! Wake up! I've come! Look, look at me..."
"Kane! Give her the pill!"
"Sia, here I am. I've come...Wake up and look at me...Sia."
"[He doesn't look in any fit state to administer this. I'll do it.]"
"[Grabs you and yells] What did you give her?!"
"I told you it's the medicine Lorsa left. If you care about her so much, why did you hide from her all these years?"
"I...I have no home. I have no roots. I am no one. I am the shadow of a person. There is nothing that I can give her..."
"You can't or you won't?"
"I..."
"Tangut is long gone. There is no hope in restoring it. Stop dreaming! Don't let Sia waste her life waiting for you!"
"I know. But how can I think to put my personal happiness above my country's honor?"
"Kane, wake up! Tangut is gone. It is not coming back. You need to move on!"
"I am late..."
"Why are you here? Sia's wound..."
"It's better now. Lorsa's medicine really works. You were right. There is nothing I can do about Tangut. I should wake up."
"Good! What's the plan now?"
"I just want to find a peaceful place to spend the rest of my life with Sia. If the Mongols come, I will fight them. If they don't, I will not bother with them either."
"It works for Sia. Let's get out of here and meet Regan and the others."
"Welcome, guests! We Beggars treat friends well!"
"Eh? Are you new? You don't look familiar."
"...Yes, Chief."
"Come. [Lowers voice.] Inform Ramona of what's happened. [Raises voice.] Arrange rooms for these guests then go to the main hall to help."
"Don't worry. I'll teach him a little respect."
"[Low voice.] Do not be stupid. This Gold Kanet is not one to be messed with. Fetch Chief Ramona now!"
"Right on it."
"That's how you treat your guests? Just one low-rank Beggar to receive us?"
"Impressive...Who is your master?"
"My master is...Chief, let's beat this lot before we talk about that."
"[Looking at you suspiciously.] Good point. This lot won't prove to be any trouble."
"[Seems Big Foot is really dependent on Ramona. But Ramona is no where to be found. I must find a way to contain them now.]"
"What are you thinking?"
"Chief, I am thinking..."
"What is this?"
"Ugh, Chief there has been a misunderstanding."
"It better be only a misunderstanding. First you come here with a fake invitation, then you injure one of our people! You've hardly endeared yourself to us."
"I really didn't know it was a fake. And it really was Rihane that gave it to me."
"Rihane? When did you meet her? Why would she trick you like that?"
"Chief, can we please talk about all this when we've defeated the enemy?"
"...What if you are working with them yourself?"
"I will prove that I am not."
"You are %s? Heir of the Southern Lords! Who would have thought we would meet under these circumstances."
"Forgive me for disguising myself earlier."
"Of course. Back to business. What do you think Gold Kanet is after by making an appearance here?"
"He did the same thing at Cyrus Palace. Perhaps now he is eyeing the Beggar Sect."
"I should investigate it right away. You go discuss it further with Chief Ramona."
"Good plan. Take care."
"Why? I wouldn't miss your convention for the world!"
"%s? It is you, is it not? Pretending to be a little Beggar to fool me?"
"Gold Kanet, we meet again."
"So, this convention is held to elect a powerful individual to be the new chief Beggar, is it not?"
"What's that got to do with you?"
"Well, the Beggar Sect has operations in the North, does it not? As the North is now Mongol territory, I, as Mongol Minster, of course have every right to know of the business of the Beggar Sect."
"That land was taken by force. It is yours only by conquest and slaughter. The business of our people is not your business!"
"Enough prattle. I have my own proposed candidate for the role: my first apprentice, Delsin, a powerful young man in his own right. He is a perfect candidate. Who dares challenge him?"
"I do!"
"Delsin, play a round or two with %s then!"
"Delsin has very strong arms. I should try to use that."
"Impressive. %s, your power has grown!"
"Well, I suppose my perfunctory visit has reached a natural conclusion then. But I promise you I will return when the convention commences."
"Your candidate has lost. Why are you coming back?"
"Haha. %s, losing a battle does not mean losing the war. This here was only practice. "
"Who the Beggars elect to be their new chief is their own business. Why don't you mind your own business?"
"A question you might ask yourself."
"Big Foot, tell Ramona I expect to see her soon."
"You, come here."
"...He found me out!"
"We are out of wine. Go get more! Keene, Patton, drink, drink before we fight with the Beggars."
"Yes, we should drink more, Gold Kanet. [You won't be able to get up tomorrow, with any luck.]"
"What are you waiting for? Go! Eh? You look familiar...You look like that little scum, %s. You really do, haha. Are you..."
"Gold Kanet, today is the day you die!"
"That is for me to decide!"
"Suit yourself!"
"Retreat!"
"You can't make a decision like this. What if the lord objects?"
"I will talk to the lord myself. You don't need to get mouthy. "
"I have a plan. Let them come!"
"I had a feeling this convention was going to attract unwelcome guests. The Mongols will make their next move soon. Hopefully Big Foot will get to the bottom of this. Then we will know how to deal with them."
"I am sure he will."
"You are %s? Why are you dressed as such?"
"Long story. [You tell her about how Rihane gave you a fake invitation.]"
"Really...Rihane is really quite unpleasant sometimes. Nonetheless, I hope you can forgive her. I will certainly give her a good lecturing when she gets here."
"It's ok. But I'd like to have my name cleared."
"Big Foot is...No."
"Chief Ramona...Please...punish me...I lost our holy token.."
"Big Foot..."
"Find...Dog Cane...or, I will know...no peace..."
"I promise I will find it!"
"I...I..."
"Farewell, Chief Big Foot..."
"I swear to avenge Big Foot and get back the Dog Cane. Whoever finds the Dog Cane - mercy let it not be a Mongol - will be the next Chief!"
"My condolences, Ramona."
"There is no way Big Foot would have died in battle under normal circumstances. He mentioned an ambush. Could Gold Kanet have played a nasty hand?"
"We can ask the three men that came back."
"I should question them myself. But I need to attend to Big Foot's funeral arrangements. %s, can you go ask them for me? "
"Ok. I will."
"What happened when you went after Gold Kanet?"
"All three of them have three different stories?"
"Too soon to say. Are they all reliable?"
"I don't really know. Since I passed the seat to Big Foot, I only consult on matters he can't decide on. I don't know much about these new recruits. I should have paid more attention..."
"Please don't blame yourself. This could not have been your fault."
"I can't send any of us to inspect the scene, to make sure no suspicions arise from this. %s, can you do it for me?"
"He  was so confident that he ambushed them here?"
"Where is this? You...Are you the crane's owner?"
"When did Hanes become so popular... Anyway, thank heavens you are here now. Was there any trouble?"
"I followed Gold Kanet to Verdant Woods, then...[You tell her what happened in the woods.]"
"The girl seems to know a lot about the Mongols and  about us. Do you know anything about her background? As for the mole, we may have a lead."
"Hanes?"
"Yes. He's been trying to pick fights among the Beggars. Today being the big day, I'd wager he must have something planned. We need him to reveal his true colors to the crowd sooner rather than later."
"I think he will reveal himself if we give him the opportunity."
"Funny, Hanes could never have been considered your equal in power. So how come he was able to fight with you for so long?"
"The techniques and skills he was using looked very familiar..."
"I have a feeling it was not Hanes at all. His skills were far too exotic for it to have been him.  Plus did you notice how much of an effort he was making to hold back the full effect of his skills?"
"We probably know him too, or else he wouldn't try so hard."
"Exactly. Let's go see who he really is."
"A shell! And inside is...the Dog Cane!"
"What a happy coincidence! %s, you've done us a great service!"
"You are too kind, Ramona."
"As the reclaimer of the Dog Cane you are now the Beggar School's new chief! %s, I trust your character. I am much assured, were it not you..."
"No, Ramona, please! I, %s , am used to being a loner. This is too big a responsibility for me..."
"But I am sure it's a responsibility you can shoulder. I know of your success over the years. And I've seen your power and character."
"Ramona, really. I..."
"The Dog Cane lost! How am I going to face the Old Beggar..."
"Don't blame yourself yet. Regan must have other plans."
"The Dog Cane taken from under our noses! %s, how do you know this heathen? And what is this about the Lotus Sigil they were talking about?"
"I first came across them in the desert...[You tell her everything about the sigil.]"
"The Royal Cavalier were escorting some cargo for us, but the Sigil was definitely not in it. I can't believe Regan would make an enemy on such weak evidence. There must be more to it. %s, investigate it please."
"By all means."
"We can still make peace. I'll find out what's going on."
"The Lotus Creed keeps to itself. The Beggar Sect has no relations with them. How is it there is a friend of the Beggar Sect among them?"
"I assume you are talking about a young man named Kane."
"Oh? You know him? What's his story?"
"Yes. His grandfather was grandmaster Trawet. His grandmother was the Tangut Princess."
"Trawet was our former Chief Nalon's sworn brother. This must be some sign from the Lotus Creed."
"We will understand after we talk to him."
"%s, the Mongols are deeply entrenched in Green Waves. Looks like they are camping here. River Town is not far south. It must be their target. Eh? Who is this?"
"This is Sonta. Here to help us."
"Good. Good! Welcome."
"What more on the Mongols?"
"They are carrying Lord Naxos' banner. But he is not here. Gold Kanet and a bunch of Mongol warriors are stationed there."
"Him again. I deal with him once and for all this time."
"The camp is well set. Gold Kanet came prepared."
"Regan is true to his word."
"The Lotus Creed has taken a lot of pressure off River Town by declaring war on the Mongols."
"The ‘heathens’ are taking the lead in defending our country. How ashamed we ‘righteous’ schools should feel about ourselves. If only the Old Beggar were here..."
"Any idea where the Old Beggar has gone?"
"The last reports had him at Mount Hua hunting the Border Agitators. Other than that, nothing..."
"Mount Hua...How about I take a trip there, see if I can find him, and bring him back to rally the sect to defend River Town?"
"My heart's desire hides from me."
"How I wish to be with him..."
"Excuse me. Did you save me?"
"Snow Spiders are rare poisonous creatures from the western mountains. You'll need a couple more days to completely clear your body of the poison. This is the best place to heal."
"Thank you. But I have an important matter to attend to. I will excuse myself then."
"Your kind always have important matters to attend to. I guess that old man did too. What a pity. A whole life of dedication to a cause, and to end up like this..."
"What old man? What do you know?"
"The bamboo sprouts are the freshest in this season. Their leaves are the loveliest to drink with. Would you collect some for me?"
"Big Foot died in an ambush. If you know something, please do tell me."
"Do you not want to collect bamboos for me?"
"Let the zither sing my sorrow..."
"Let the sun see my longing..."
"Let the moon declare my love..."
"Let the bamboos know my tears..."
"Why is she having me do all this? How has she survived in this place?"
"Let me just see what she does next."
"Look how the sprout wraps about itself for protection. But look how easy it is to peel the skins off."
"Are you hinting at something?"
"The Beggar Sect operates in the north. Of course the Mongols have their eyes on them. The Sect knows this, but instead of staying low, they host a grand convention. Practically suicidal."
"The Mongols are at our door. Of course we should all come together to fight them."
"And you think going against them head on is the right way to do it now? Ramona is only holding the convention to boost morale for River Town. Yet you all dance to the tune you think she's playing."
"That's enough of that. I just want to know how Big Foot died. You don't need to talk to me about other things."
"You've got an attitude for someone that's asking for favors. Sit. Drink with me."
"I will drink with you."
"First cup: Bitter Tea. Koen and Ramona beat Gold Kanet . This convention gave him an opportunity for revenge."
"Second cup: Sweet Tea. With Big Foot dead, the Beggar Sect is back under Ramona's control. This could be a good thing, as Big Foot lacked virtue and intelligence. But if Gold Kanet was responsible for his death, it begs the question what is his end game?"
"Last cup: The Lingering Tea. Gold Kanet's retreat was far too sweet and showy. If my guess is correct, he staged the whole thing and he is not working alone."
"Your best strategy is to wait at home and see who eventually shows their hand which, of course, is exactly what they will do. Do not waste time and effort chasing down Gold Kanet."
"Thank you for enlightening me."
"How are you feeling after drinking the tea?"
"I feel perfect! What was in the tea?"
"Certain counters to the Snow Spider poison. Do you want to practice a little and see if your power has returned? Try sparing with Crane."
"I think it would do me some good to move about a bit."
"Good. You are completely recovered. There is nothing more I can help you with now. Leave when you wish to."
"I thank you for everything!"
"Before you go, promise me something."
"Of course."
"I am here to look for someone. He doesn't want to see me. No, he is scared of seeing me. I am tired of waiting for him to come for me...Can you help me find him?"
"Um...what does he look like?"
"He is...really special. His presence is so unique. You will be able to spot him right away."
"...Ok... [How am I gonna spot him when I don't know how he looks like!]"
"How things change."
"Who is that girl? Why does she call my godfather 'father'? Is that Sweeper you are holding?"
"Sia. When did you get here? Regan is your god father? His birth name is Orson. He used to be the Creed of Five's Enforcer."
"That is so...Will he go back to the Far South with her? Any news on the one I am looking for?"
"Um...I haven't really got the time..."
"It's ok. I wasn't expecting too much from you...He won't even see me, let alone others. Sweeper only works if you burn it. Go dry the ones you have."
"Ok."
"Do we know who %s is? No, we don't. But Ramona keeps protecting this stranger! Why?"
"I admire Chief Ramona's eccentric brilliance, but this is strange indeed. We must get an answer today!"
"%s! You beat our fellow Beggar! Maybe Ramona won't punish you but I will! Brothers, get this scum!"
"%s, you are too nosy for your own good."
"Hey, you sound like you know me well?"
"Ugh...Of course, the Beggars know all the street talk! What's wrong about that?"
"Oh, yea...Right."
"You shut it! You won't sweet talk your way out of this! You will answer for what you did. Once I've taken the Dog Cane from you I will ask for Ramona's pardon."
"By 'ask for her pardon' do you mean steal her position?!"
"Things are so interesting out here!"
"Thank you! I am Sonta. It's my first day out on the road alone. What's your name?"
"I am %s. Good to see you."
"You're the %s!? Oh, what an honor to meet you!"
"%s is my name, yes. Thank you."
"You are so humble! You look like you were just in a fight. What's that about?"
"Mongols are here. I am heading to meet Ramona."
"Really? Can I come too? I heard Ramona is holding a convention to elect a chief for Beggar Sect and unite us against the Mongols. I hope I am not too late."
"Too late for the convention. But in plenty of time for the Mongols."
"Good enough for me! I'll go with you. I would like to see how things turn out between the Lotus Creed and Beggar Sect too."
"You know the Lotus Creed is here?"
"Yes. The Mongols took their Persian base. The Song sect is openly fighting with the Mongols. I would join them, but they have a bad reputation."
"Let's go then."
"Gold Kanet seems important!"
"He is the Mongol Minister. He recruits Song warriors for Lord Naxos. He does rank high among the Mongols."
"Looks like the Mongols were confident they could take over the Beggar Sect. But they couldn't have known that the Lotus Creed would join forces with the Beggar Sect against them. Ha!"
"Don't let your guard down yet. Gold Kanet truly is powerful. We should tread carefully if we want to beat him."
"Ok. He will learn the news soon. Let's mingle before he does."
"Let's get some Mongol Uniforms."
"Haha. Good! Let's declare war against them then!"
"Sonta, stop it!"
"What? %s, I told you I hate the Mongols. The only reason I am here is to fight them. If the Lotus Creed is raising their banners. Then I am joining."
"The Lotus Creed keeps to itself. They don't travel with outsiders."
"I will join the Creed then!"
"Sonta, you are sure of what you are doing?"
"Who would have thought our story would end here?"
"We are on the right track. Banes is here. Heart Worms take ten years to mature, so these soldiers can't be the real thing. They must be his failed attempts."
"Even the failed attempts are powerful! If they were incubating real Heart Worms, we would be dead now."
"Banes must have some end game planned. Don't let your guard down. Ugh, the smell...I am right."
"What is it?"
"When undead soldiers experience true death, the worms decay and give out a noxious gas. Go get us some Sweepers."
"The Sweeper fragrance might clear away the worm smell. There must be plenty around, or else Banes wouldn't have left so many Undead Soldiers so close to his lair, in case they die and poison him."
"I will go look for some then."
"Good. You know to dry them first before burning them."
"No, it's not me. Sia taught me that."
"Sia who?"
"Oh, Sia, you know, your father's goddaughter."
"Goddaughter? I haven't heard anything from my father for over a dozen years...He wouldn't come back. I couldn't let anyone find out where I was...Well, not now. Let's burn the Sweepers."
"...Ok. [She looks dispirited.]"
"It should be here."
"A dark cave in the middle of the mountain."
"Yes. Caves like this are the favored habitat of the worms. Banes must be here."
"Here it is then."
"Careful, there must be lots of worms here. I will lead. Follow closely."
"Ok. Be careful."
"Ah!"
"Banes is only good at little tricks like this. %s, let's charge ahead!"
"It is Banes!"
"He looks strange..."
"The smell...This is a mature Heart Worm! He is no longer a person. The worm has turned him into a beast."
"He used it on himself!"
"A caged dog will bite. %s, take this worm egg and do as I say."
"Yes."
"What to do with Banes?"
"Yes, your father....Regan asked me to ask you what you want to do with Banes..."
"[Glances at Regan with sad eyes.] Does he not want to talk to me himself? Well...[Voice taking on a steely edge] Banes is a traitor. Traitors die."
"But he must know the Mongols' plan here. Is not capturing and questioning him better?"
"%s, I will not hand over Banes to anyone. When a follower betrays the Creed, only the Creed can deal with it. No need to talk about it, Banes must die today."
"...[She is quite determined.] I see."
"My mission is done here. I should get back to base. As for father...He is one of the Lotus Creed followers now. Where his heart belongs...he won't be accepted with us..."
"Is there no other way..."
"No need to be sad. Father was always soft. It is understandable that he broke down when he thought I was dead. But I never thought he would join a different creed and take in another daughter..."
"You do mind, don't you...You're jealous."
"How can I be? I never told him I was alive all these years. Sia is a better daughter than I am. I am going back to the Far South. Take this medicine to Sia. It will help with her wounds."
"Lorsa...Take care."
"Father, I am leaving. Take care."
"Sia!"
"You too..."
"Kneel to the...chief..."
"I saved my best spider for today!"
"I am...not afraid...of you! You...are going to...die today!"
"You joined the Jurchens and Mongols against your very own. You have sinned!"
"Only with their help can the Creed take Dali and then Song...Stupid!"
"You are still so stubborn!"
"The Creed...is going to wither...in your hands!"
"...[What a sad creature.]"
"The Five wish you to die!"
"No!"
"You and...Lorsa...will both die!"
"It's either you or me today."
"Join the Beggars and you'll suffer the rage of lotus fire!"
"I do not wish to fight you, but you are not leaving me much choice!"
"You are making this up! You are the bad one!"
"The guilty ones cry the loudest."
"You are crossing the line!"
"Go to Beggar Arena."
"Go to Green Waves."
"Go to Worm Lair."
"It was our fault. We should have protected him better..."
"We went to chase the Mongols. But Gold Kanet ambushed us. They took us by surprise. Big Foot had to fight Gold Kanet while helping us fight Delsin...He went down not long after, and they took the Dog Cane..."
"I see. Rest now."
"We shouldn't have split up with him!"
"When we got there, Gold Kanet was gone. But he had left a couple of monks waiting for us. Big Foot decided to go after Gold Kanet and we stayed to fight the monks. What happened after that I am not sure..."
"Monsters! So many monsters!"
"What monster? How did Big Foot get injured?"
"Ah! No! No! Monsters!"
"This one is half crazy...What monsters though..."
"Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust."
"I told you I was there at the massacre. I saw your family get slaughtered. I infiltrated The Inn and became their Whisperer. I learned more things there."
"How did the Occult slaughter the five most prominent families in the south in one night?"
"I won't tell you how Logan planned the hit."
"What will you tell me then?"
"Where your family's half of the Volume of War is now. Ahh...It's getting cold. We need more logs. Go get me some."
"[I see you still remember your old trade.] Then you'll tell me more?"
"If not for %s, I wouldn't have gotten to see you today either, just like every other day."
"What difference does it make? Why would you care for a nun? I have no desire in returning to the outside world."
"I was too late in discovering my true feelings. Now I just want a second chance."
"Not knowing is better than knowing too late.  "
"Not to me it isn't."
"That will be enough. Thank you."
"So?"
"It is hard for us to get water here. Can you go get some ice for us to keep?"
"Ice for water...Good thinking."
"When you are back, come meet me at the Temple of Mercy."
"I hope you can tell me more then."
"You know them?"
"They stole volumes from the Monastery. I promised to help get them back."
"Keene and Patton, those are Gold Kanet's people. Why would they steal from the Monastery? Wait, what volumes did they steal exactly?"
"[She looks so concerned all of a sudden.] Four volumes of the original Lanka Sutra."
"The snow is colder here..."
"To this day, they still have loyal followers. I pity them: they were abandoned a long time ago and they will never receive anything for the loyalty they exhibit."
"%s, how have you been?"
"Messenger! You became a nun?"
"I am a Messenger no more. I am Wisdom. I reside here at Cloud Temple with the Mistress Tranquility."
"That's why I haven't heard about you for so long. Who is Mistress Tranquility?"
"You know her too. She is the old Whisperer, Carla, also known as Dia from the Occult."
"She...I guess Ezra sent her here. But why are you here with her?"
"Are those Lotus Creed's element fighters? Impressive!"
"Right. Today is the day of the Lotus Creed and Mount Hua duel. No wonder they are shutting down the road."
"A duel? Pah. Mount Hua has more to gain from this than the Lotus Creed, even if they lose. After all, Mount Hua has only become famous recently, while Lotus Creed's history is long and illustrious."
"I don't know why this is happening either."
"Element fighters have skills unique to each individual. These here are the Earth Fighters. They are best at surprise attacks."
"Good point. It might work in our favor."
"You mean if you don't stay in one place, they wouldn't know where to dig and come out to surprise us?"
"Yes."
"I don't think they will attack us if you reveal who you are. I remember you being close with the Lotus Creed."
"Looks like you've grown to hate conflict."
"The only type of conflict I like is one that doesn't escalate."
"[To be safe, I should take their weapons and reveal myself, in case of damage on either side.]"
"Why block the way? What are you hiding?"
"Looks like you are not a good enough friend."
"Whatever. I will take a look in the cave. What about you?"
"What about those two you were chasing just now?"
"After I sort everything out with this bunch."
"Alright. You go. I will check around for them. Meet me at the Summit Arena when you are done."
"Thanks."
"%s, what's going on? Isn't he the Earth Elder? Why is the Lotus Creed after him?"
"Long story. Are you hurt?"
"No, it's ok. He didn't hurt me."
"Take care. He may not have hurt you but he could still hurt someone else."
"Ok."
"How is he?"
"Nothing serious. He is just passed out for now. He was purposefully keeping us from finding out his plan. See, there is always trouble and scheming where Nell is involved."
"Nell? You want to be Nell again?"
"Carla wishes for me to rejoin the outside world. I should be happy to. It would make her happy."
"As long as you both are happy."
"I don't mind. It's all the same to me. If Carla doesn't want my company, I may as well leave. I just hope she doesn't let the past keep her from being happy now. %s, let's say our goodbyes here."
"Farewell, Nell. "
"I am an orphan. Carla, no, Mistress Tranquility, brought me up and taught me all I know. She is like my mother. Of course I would follow my mother."
"I see...But you are still so young..."
"But I've seen plenty. The world outside is interesting. But here, well, the tranquility appeals to me, I guess."
"Young and wise. If you guys ever need anything, just let me know. Ok?"
"Mount Hua wouldn't dare mess with The Inn. So we've been at peace with the people here. But the Frost Wolves are a different story."
"Let me take care of them."
"But you are even more powerful now!"
"There is always someone stronger, though. You must keep practicing."
"Indeed. We need to practice to keep strong and keep our loved ones safe..."
"Where is the Cloud Temple? I should pay Whisperer a visit."
"The Inn already has a new Whisperer. Now, in Cloud Temple, she is Mistress Tranquility. I can take you there."
"A Crowning Arbor on top of Mount Hua. How clever!"
"Sun sets and moon rises."
"Beasts fall and soil grows fertile."
"Thus is the circle of life."
"And what is a crown if but a circle."
"How profound of you."
"Are you a like-minded friend then? I am Raleigh, and you are?"
"I am %s. Glad to meet you."
"You are %s. What a pleasure to finally meet you. What is your business here in Mount Hua?"
"I have come looking for the Old Beggar."
"Is the Old Beggar here?"
"I am not sure. But he was last seen here."
"I see. I am a Gold Fighter. We have many brothers here. Maybe we can help you keep an eye out. Would you like to come back with me?"
"You move fast. It was not long ago that Regan wished to come north and now you are already at Mount Hua."
"You know wherever the elder points, we go. But we didn't come to fight the Mongols, rather to settle a debt. I will tell you all about it on the way back."
"Yes, please."
"In recent years, five schools of swordsmanship have risen to fame: the schools in Mount Song, Mount Hua, the Southern Mount and Northern Mount and Mount Tai."
"For whatever reason they decided to join together against the Lotus Creed."
"The elders decided to scare them off and invited Mount Hua for this duel."
"So you came to fight Mount Hua?"
"Yes. The Ten Elders will represent us in the duel. Mount Hua is no match for us. They have only one good man. He knows the Lonely Nine skill."
"The Lonely Nine...[Is he related to Albelt then?]"
"Speak of the devil. Sorry for getting you into this, %s."
"No need. The so called righteous are becoming outrageous! How's your wound?"
"Only a scratch...that won't stop bleeding."
"Let's stanch it."
"A mix of Red Tear with the booze I have would do the trick."
"You go find a place to rest. I will go get some Red Tear."
"Thank you, %s. I can't move my arms. Perhaps you can help me put it on?"
"Of course."
"Thank you. Mount Hua skill is nothing to be feared. But they outnumbered us..."
"Yes, they did."
"Northern Beggar and Western Venom never got along with each other yet now they rest next to each other. What irony. I wonder who built these graves."
"Look, it says: [Godson Albelt prays for....] It was Albelt."
"%s, now you know the Old Beggar has left us. What are you going to do?"
"I need to report to Ramona about this. Thank you for all your help."
"It's our pleasure, %s."
"Yes. It's our pleasure."
"We have been gone for too long. We should get back..."
"Of course. Could I ask whether you still have some booze left?"
"Yes. I have half a bottle left. You want it?"
"I hope the Old Beggar won't mind this cheap booze of mine. %s, we should really get back. If you like, you can come and watch the fight."
"When I've honored them, I will drop by."
"Let me clear the snow away for you..."
"I know you're powerful. No need to play the good guy. Why don't you just kill us? Just like you and those from Mount Hua murdered the Ten Elders!"
"Raleigh, listen! This has all been misconstrued!"
"Misconstrued, bah! Rai testified against you! There was no way one man could have slain all of our elders! Even if the cave collapsed, they should have been able to get out!"
"Rai? Mount Hua offered them poisoned tea. That's why they couldn't get out."
"And you were there when they did this? Why did you not stop them? You were there. You must have known they were going to blow up the cave. How can you not be one of them!"
"Raleigh!  [A familiar figure walks over.] Rance!"
"Make sure nothing goes wrong in this fight."
"Raleigh, Raleigh! Are you okay?"
"Raleigh! Who are you...?"
"I am %s. Glad to make your acquaintance."
"%s, I've heard a lot about you. I am Baird, a Gold Fighter."
"My pleasure."
"We've found a lead on the Old Beggar. Would you like to go check it with us?"
"So soon! Impressive! Please."
"%s, this way."
"Aww."
"This baby will perish if we leave it here. We should take it back to raise."
"Good plan. But I don't have a home. Maybe you can take it back to Lotus Creed."
"That would be great! The Snow Jaguar is a noble species."
"This one is lovely too. But I don't think I am the right one for it."
"In any case. Thank you for giving it to us. Let's continue on."
"Please."
"The Old Beggar is right ahead. Please."
"They look strange. What is it?"
"This grave...Then the Old Beggar is...?"
"Indeed. We were surprised too. These graves look at least a few years old. The Old Beggar probably passed long ago."
"That could be. Ramona said he was last seen here hunting for the Border Agitators."
"Did you notice the other one over there? Do you know who is it for?"
"Who?"
"Take a look."
"I will."
"Soren!"
"%s, this is fate perhaps."
"This is pure bad luck."
"Just the person I didn't want to see. "
"What have you done this time?"
"Still so nosy, I see. I suggest you be smart and let us be. There are two of us and only one of you."
"I have to be nosy when it comes to you two."
"%s, why can't you just leave us alone. We've cut all ties with the Mongols."
"But you are still doing illicit work, are you not?"
"Conspiracy to steal is just as bad as the act of stealing."
"Gentlemen, you borrowed our Lanka Sutra volumes when I was meditating and never returned them. I hope you can return them to us now please."
"These two are villains. Asking nicely isn't going to get them to give them back."
"Actually I am not sure whether it was them that borrowed the sutra. They wouldn't really tell the whole story."
"Why not beat it out of them then? It's not like they have a good record."
"No. Innocent until proven guilty. I won't blame them for things they might not have done."
"[What a nice monk. But nice is not going to work for these two. Let me search them first.]"
"Of course I don't have the sutra!"
"I don't either."
"They don't have it. Of course, they hid it somewhere else..."
"You won't understand the volumes as they are the originals. If you really would like to read them, I can lend you the translated versions. Just please return the ones you've borrowed."
"Master, they did not steal them to learn Buddhism. What else is in the volumes?"
"Um, the Sutra of Suns by the Bodhidharma himself is hidden in it. It is a technique that strengthens the physique and chakra."
"I see.  [It must be a very sought after skill volume.]"
"The Sutra of Suns itself doesn't matter to us as much as it being in the original copy of the Lanka Sutra does. We need it back."
"[I should help Master Clarion get it back then.]"
"%s, I don't want to mess with you. But I really don't have it. You can't make me give you something I don't have."
"Do not push us! My power doesn't equal yours, but I have the fortitude to oppose you, I promise!"
"Do you now?"
"We should let them go. It seems they really do not have it. If they did, and have hidden it somewhere, karma will catch up with them, I guarantee it."
"Really? How will you face the monastery?"
"We will accept any punishment the monastery deigns us deserving of. You have a good heart, you know doing this is the right thing."
"You would suffer a punishment for someone else's wrongdoing?"
"Kegan and I are responsible for the loss of the sutra too. We shall be punished for it. If it is really them that stole the sutra, their punishment will find them, as I said."
"I see. What if I help you track down the sutra? To be honest, I would like to read the Sutra of Suns myself."
"That would be much appreciated. But do bring the volumes back to us when you find them."
"Thank you. Please do bring them back to us."
"They went that way. I should follow them."
"Mongols. Clarion said he saved them from a Mongol attack. Looks like it was a play."
"Master is too kind. They used him..."
"This one doesn't have it on him. It must be on the other one."
"Wait. What if he hurts you?"
"Don't worry. I might not beat him, but he wouldn't be able to hurt me either. As long as we get Lanka Sutra back, I will do anything."
"You are sure it is them who took it?"
"Yes. I was reading in the hall while master was meditating. One of them froze my body by closing my chakras, but I saw them leaving with the volumes."
"I would say it's them, too. But they look very pleased with themselves, which I think is strong indication that they've stored the volumes elsewhere."
"What then? How would we know where they hid them? No, I will have to search them myself. "
"[He's mastered the Sutra of Suns. Very ambitious. I underestimated him.]"
"They still won't talk!"
"Let's think of another way."
"Master and I chased them from the Monastery to Mount Hua. But still we haven't found the sutra. How are we going to face the Monastery..."
"Don't worry. We've got them."
"It wouldn't make much difference. Master is too kind. They will play him again. And he will let them go..."
"You will never get the sutra that way."
"What is that? Master, look a Snow Ape!"
"It's coming this way! Watch out!"
"Roar."
"Roar. [This ape is charging at the monks.]"
"Where did it come from?"
"All I have left to remember is your lonely shadow..."
"So many people at the summit. Who are you?"
"I am %s. And you are?"
"You are %s? Then you must know Albelt! He talks of you often! I am Ria. Do you know where Albelt is now?"
"You've grown! I haven't seen Albelt since he chose to retire with Adrial."
"Even you don't know...I've been looking for him. I heard of an Ice Crystal at Mount Hua that makes great weapons, so I came hoping I might bump into him. He was very interested in this kind of thing, you see..."
"I can't help you find Albelt. But I can help you get the Ice Crystals."
"You got so many! Thank you! But why are you here at Mount Hua?"
"Actually, I was sent here by your mother...[You tell her what happened at Mount Hua.]"
"You are so chivalrous. But what are you going to do now that you lost Keene and Patton?"
"I plan to go to the Monastery and tell Clarion what happened. I also plan to ask him for a favor...What about you?"
"Me? I don't know. I miss Albelt. There is no news of him anywhere. But maybe I can try at the Monastery. Master Chastiser is Albelt's good friend. Can I, perhaps, go with you?"
"Of course. Come."
"Do not come closer!"
"%s? The Southern Lords' heir?"
"I am Rai, Elder of the Earth Fighters. Mount Hua and the Lotus Creed are holding a duel here. %s , please take your friend and find another way to go."
"I don't intend to interfere with your duel. But there is only one way down and up Mount Hua. Please let us through."
"%s, please do forgive us. Our Ten Elders and the best of Mount Hua are all in the cave right now. We can't let anything or anyone cause any disturbance."
"I am not trying to get into the cave. I just need to pass through to give chase to an enemy."
"So many guards. But they are from Mount Hua. Where are the Lotus followers? I need to find a way in."
"Did you hear that? I will go check. You stay here."
"I'll go with you."
"%s, you schemer! You dare confront me! You killed our Ten Elders!"
"No. Why are you accusing me of something you know I could not possibly have done?"
"Did you not just break through our blockades to meet your Mount Hua conspirators in the cave? You are no friend of ours!"
"I was only passing through. It was you who would not let me pass. Why is that then? Why would you not let anyone pass through?"
"To keep out any disturbance, of course! I was right to block you! Look at what your friends have done."
"I think you blocked our way so nobody would find out about your scheme?"
"I can let you go, but do not hurt Nell. Or else I will make sure you suffer!"
"You think I am not suffering now?"
"Looks like I got the right hostage. Look at you all nervous!"
"Shut it! Are you going to leave or not?"
"Of course I will leave. These are good people. Do not hurt them..."
"Now you remember your people."
"How dare you say I don't care for them? I've never said a harsh word to them! This, this is the first time I've ever wronged them..."
"If you release Nell, I will  ask Rance to go easy on you."
"You think I would believe that? I will set her free when I am safe. Do not follow me!"
"Regan? Finally, a friendly face...[You tell him about the Earth Fighters.]"
"Earth Elder Rai has a big ego. You took his weapon, of course he is acting out. Don't mind him."
"You are joining the fight?"
"Of course. Mount Hua is sending their best to challenge our Ten Elders. I really want to see that Lonely Nine skill."
"I see."
"%s, Albelt learned his swordsman skill from Master Uncontested. Perhaps he learned The Lonely Nine from him too. Have you seen Albelt use it?"
"No. Albelt didn't learn The Lonely Nine. I'd like to see how tough this Wind is."
"%s, stay and watch the fight then."
"Thank you for giving me this chance! This is going to be a good fight."
"Sure. Just watch though. Don't try to step in. Let me take you to the arena."
"Ok."
"%s, thank Lotus God, you are alive..."
"Regan! What's wrong...What did they do?"
"They planted dynamite...They were no match for us...So they gave us this tea during break...poison in the tea.."
"Treacherous pigs!"
"Won't do any good now...I am glad you are unharmed...Wind is here...At least, the world will know what really happened..."
"Regan, stop now. I will help you cure the poison."
"No! They would not have done such a thing!"
"Heir of the Lonely Nine...You are about the only pure soul left on Mount Hua..."
"%s...Stop. It's no use...It's too late..."
"Regan, no! No!"
"Get out of here...Take care of Lorsa and Sia...I...I won't make it..."
"Regan..."
"Don't move my body...The worms will carry my soul back to the Five..."
"...Farewell, Regan..."
"Mount Hua's best fighter doesn't even use Mount Hua skills. And the elders esteem him so. How unfair..."
"Who are you! Outsiders are not welcome here!"
"I am %s, here to watch the fight and track down someone."
"Track down who? The only people here are either members of the Mount Hua school or the Lotus Creed. %s, no offense, but we'd like to keep this fight between the two of us. You should really turn back."
"The ones I'm looking for are outsiders. They came up this way, so they must be hiding in the cave somewhere."
"Not possible! Just get out of here!"
"Why are you so eager to get rid of me? Are you plotting something?"
"Whatever are you talking about! Brothers, kick this outsider out!"
"He's nervous...Could they be up to something?"
"%s, don't you have a reputation to keep? Why do you insist on giving us trouble here?"
"But I am here to be your witness. In case someone accuses you of scheming, I can help clear your name."
"What are you insinuating? We may be enemies, but Mount Hua will not taint our name with Lotus blood."
"Why are you being so defensive about this?"
"%s! Watch what you say! One more word like that and I will have to beat some sense into you!"
"Feeling pushed to a corner? Don't bite..."
"Of course these schemers are outside."
"%s, Wind! You are...alive...[He makes an effort to look happy.] It's great! We were just talking about how to rescue you!"
"Rescue us? It was you who blew the cave up. Why didn't you warn us?"
"It was...There was no time. You were far away. Heavens, I was so worried about you two!"
"Cut it out. Regan told me everything."
"You believe that heathen? They almost got us all killed in there."
"Liar!"
"Wind, you won't trust %s's words over mine, will you? We are brothers. You know me.  Would I leave you to die?"
"But it was you who planted the dynamite. Why didn't you tell me about that? Just because they are heathens, doesn't mean we can play tricks on them like this. We are the righteous and just ones. Rain, you are in the wrong here."
"Fine! I admit I was wrong. But all the heathen elders are now dead! Just think what a good deed I have done. Do you not see it?"
"I...I don't know. I don't want to think about it now."
"%s, I think there is some sort of misunderstanding here."
"How ridiculous!"
"No one shall insult Mount Hua in my presence!"
"Who's talking nonsense now?!"
"You're %s? You disappoint me."
"You disappoint me more."
"I have only one question for you. Do you have any proof that Mount Hua is playing dirty? If not, I would ask you to stop this kind of talk."
"First the Lotus Creed blocks off the road. Then Mount Hua starts to drive people away. What's there to hide, if not foul play?"
"It's all in your imagination. Apologize to us right now, or answer to my sword!"
"Sword it is then!"
"Wind, the fights are not over yet. You guys can't fight here. Go inside in there to fight %s."
"Ok. %s, let's go."
"Wind from Mount Hua, at your service."
"It will be my pleasure to experience the Lonely Nine today."
"Only the righteous can master the true power. With your talent, it's a shame you have such a heart."
"You are too fast to judge. Can you honestly vouch your brothers are just?"
"We are holding a fair duel with the Lotus Creed. You come in and accuse my brothers of foul play. They fight you to defend Mount Hua's name. There is nothing unjust about it."
"If Rain is not doing anything wrong, why is he so nervous and defensive?"
"Would you like to have someone accuse you of being vile? He didn't handle it very well. And that's all there is."
"Of course you take his side."
"I am not taking his side. I am just..."
"There is no point in us arguing here."
"What do you want to do then?"
"Just wait and watch. If nothing happens, I will apologize."
"I will be eagerly awaiting your apology, %s."
"Not so fast..."
"Rain! Hello? Anyone there?"
"The entrance is blocked! We are stuck. Where are Rain and the others? I hope they are not hurt."
"Wind, I told you, they were the ones who planted the dynamite. It's not likely they're harmed..."
"You don't know that. Rain is not an unjust person. He would never."
"You will see what kind of a person he really is when we are out of here. Come, hold this."
"What is this? A weird shovel? %s, you want to dig out?"
"Not exactly. This cave is hundreds of meters deep. It would take us years to dig through. Let's dig our way to the arena."
"Who knew these would come in handy..."
"We would die in here if not for these."
"We are lucky, the ground is soft here."
"Let's hurry. We need to get out before the whole ceiling collapses."
"Let's hurry."
"...[He looks bothered.]"
"Wind, what do you think?"
"Maybe...Rain thought using dirty tricks against the heathens would not be so wrong...Maybe he thought the ends justified the means."
"Dirty tricks are dirty tricks, no matter who you use them on."
"Rain is under a lot of pressure...He is the master's first apprentice. He probably just wanted to do something big..."
"I don't care for excuses when it comes to the loss of other people's lives. I will have him answer for this."
"Look at that Snow Ape. Looks like it's stuck here. %s, you know it?"
"I was chasing its masters. Now here is a new clue."
"What luck."
"I guess there is a plan for us after all."
"We can get out...here? Is this tunnel big enough? I don't want to get stuck in the middle."
"No, you don't want to see Rain. Come on, sooner or later, you have to see what he really is."
"Rain has his reasons...%s, he's admitted it. And what's done is done, can we just..."
"You can't even convince yourself to forgive him, can you?"
"I...But he is my brother. I don't want to see any of us get hurt."
"So you let him go unpunished? The Ten Elders are turning in the ground!"
"No. I can't let him go unpunished. The Ten Elders deserve to have their justice. The Master will punish Rain for tainting Mount Hua's name."
"Even if he kills him. He still owes nine lives."
"%s, I can't make the decision here. I must tell the Master about this and follow his orders. Please understand that."
"I understand you have your way of doing things. But if you even attempt to cover for him in anyway, I will step in..."
"I know. He won't go unpunished."
"I need to get on my way now. If I hear he hasn't gotten what he deserves, be assured I will come back!"
"%s."
"Wind."
"Oaaaa. Oaaaa. [The ape is stuck and frightened.]"
"[It's Keene and Patton's Snow Ape. Are they around here too?]"
"Oaa...[The ape is looking at you with desperate eyes.]"
"Hold on. I will get you out."
"Life is just one crisis after another."
"%s. Meeting you again should have been a happy event."
"But here we are as enemies."
"Rance, you truly believe I would murder the Ten Elders?"
"We fought together. You brought Elysia, our Purple Dragon to us. You were a friend. But %s, you changed."
"Rance. You don't believe me?"
"Earth Elder testified that you broke through the Earth Fighters so as to sneak into the cave to poison Regan and the others. Then you made an excuse to leave with Wind before Mount Hua blew up the cave and murdered the Ten Elders!"
"That's not true! Rance, would you let me explain?"
"Murderers are not permitted to speak!"
"Rance..."
"I see your power has grown. It's life or death then!"
"Rance, calm down! You would take only one person's word against my character?"
"You think he framed you? Why? He doesn't even know you! Did you not wound the Earth Fighters?"
"I did. But this is how it all happened...[You tell Rance about what happened with Earth Fighters.]"
"...[He looks less angry.] %s, I really don't want to believe that you would do such a thing. But Rai has served us for so long. I have to listen to him too. I will have to question you further..."
"I will agree to that, if only to clear my name."
"Good! Come, bring Rai here!"
"Earth Elder, Rai at your service."
"What scum! And still these idiots follow him! They shall not be forgiven!"
"When there is something to be gained, it is hard to make them behave."
"To think I almost took this traitor's word against you! %s, do you forgive me?"
"Of course. What do you plan to do now?"
"Capture Rai and slay his followers! %s, care to come with?"
"My pleasure!"
"Ah! Let me go!"
"%s. look who this is!"
"No! Nell must have been waiting here for me!"
"Step back! Ask Rance to leave me be or this girl dies!"
"These people followed you through ice and fire and still all you care about is yourself!"
"They would follow him, even after he betrays our beliefs."
"He must have treated them well."
"Small doses of kindness. Time for them to clear their heads now!"
"Rance, Nell is The Inn's Messenger. She mustn't be hurt."
"I see. Let him go for now. Let's take him down when Nell is safely away."
"Thank you, Rance."
"Often it's too late when we know our true hearts."
"...I am a nun now. The past matters no more. Inn Council, please go back. I have no more to say to you."
"If the past really doesn't matter to you now, why would you avoid me so?"
"....jiedi jiedi, boluo jiedi, boluoseng jiedi, puti suopohe..."
"Carla..."
"Eh? %s?"
"Scooper, long time."
"Indeed. My luck has improved now that you are here."
"Really? Are you visiting Carla?"
"Yes. Carla and I have worked together for twenty years. I should be here. Also, I...Well, what brings you to Mount Hua?"
"Long story..."
"After Aricia died and you left Floret Island, some changes were made inside the Occult. We sent Listeners and Watchers out to keep an eye on them. We found something unexpected..."
"What was it?"
"When your grandfather took the family south, he went to the Monastery and left a few men there. But there has been no communication with them ever since."
"So you think my grandfather left them to safeguard the Volume of War?"
"Yes. Only, if he did, why have you not been contacted yet? The men should have known of your existence and fame well by now."
"...Maybe they have passed."
"But wouldn't the Monastery have sent for you in their stead? After all you are the most appropriate trustee now. And it's only proper if you take the Volume to General Brazen's family."
"I am not sure. I shall go visit the Monastery."
"I will not let you hurt the elder! Do not come closer!"
"He murdered your Creed's Ten Elders for his own benefit and you still protect him?"
"I've never met the Ten Elders, but I spent every day with him. I respect him. I love him. I will not let you or anyone hurt him."
"How bullheaded!"
"Whatever he has done, I stand by him!"
"Don't you know right and wrong?"
"Rai saved my life and gave me a place in the world. He helped me take care of my little sister. That is good. And that is enough for me."
"And what will happen to your sister after you are gone?"
"I...No! Stop!"
"He is a traitor. Your leader is the Lotus Holder! You are not his squire!"
"You stop."
"No, you listen!"
"Whatever you say, I have decided to serve Rai with my life!"
"Right now he is using you as a pawn!"
"As long as I can be useful to him!"
"Do you hear yourself?"
"Go to Forbidden Tomb."
"Go to Unnamed Cave."
"Remain unbothered and true. "
"...[Clarion sees you, smiles and bows. But he doesn't utter a word and goes on his way.] "
"Eh? Clarion! It's me, %s! Do you not recognize me?"
"...[Clarion heard you. He stops and bows to you again and then goes on his way again. ] "
"Why are you not talking to us?"
"…[He waves your question away. Obviously he doesn't want to talk about it. ] "
"What's going on? I should go ask Ria what to do. "
"…[Clarion gets nervous and looks around. He waves at you again to stop you. ] "
"What are you so nervous about?"
"…[Clarion shakes his head and looks troubled. ] "
"Master, are you..."
"Clarion, you broke the rules! You have been forbidden to talk! And you talked with an outsider no less! Come with us to see the Order Master. "
"%s, you are in trouble! These brothers will go tell everything to the master! And you will be in trouble. "
"Don't worry. I am not scared. What silly rules! How can you let them bully you like this?"
"They are not bullying me. You are mistaken. No time to explain. Hurry down the mount, now. I don't want to get you in trouble. "
"I will be fine, master. Come with us. They will punish you if you don't. "
"No, no. I need to carry this water in. You go down. Hurry now!"
"No, I won't leave without you. Where is your disciple? We will need to take him too. These chains are no good. Let me get those off of you. "
"No, no!"
"Hey, where are you going? We are trying to help you!"
"Master Clarion is too kind for his own good... "
"%s, you didn't need to damage our floor like this if you wanted to play chess! Also, what do you want with me, visitor?"
"This is the Kunlun Giant, Brooks. He brought a message from Patton for you.  Also he'd like to learn a thing or two about Monastery skills. "
"Oh, so that's why he damaged the floor for? To show off his skills? This is not right. "
"I am sure he didn't mean to damage the floor. He is just a spontaneous fellow. "
"Amitabha. He came for me. I should take care of this matter for the Monastery. %s, please step aside. "
"Ah, ok. "
"%s, what are you blocking me for?"
"Master Clarion played chess with you for me. Let me cross swords with you for him. "
"Kegan! This is not his fault. Even I had forgotten this rule, or else I would never. I would never..."
"Too late for that now. Let's think about how to save him. "
"Master Learning's old master died at the hands of a man who learned skills by himself and went rogue. He will not spare Kegan!"
"And if he decides to punish Kegan, Abbot Serenity won't be able to do anything about it. "
"I didn't teach Kegan not to learn the skills from the books. I won't see him executed for this. %s, will you help me?"
"Of course, I will!"
"Who is that? How dare you make a scene in the Monastery!"
"He's the key to saving Kegan. I must persuade him."
"Koff...ah"
"You came back! How are you feeling?"
"Ke...Kegan..."
"It's ok. Kegan is fine. "
"Ke...gan...The power lies in...This is not enough..."
"Master Clarion, what are you talking about?"
"He is playing deaf. I won't let him. Look at him, all chained up! They must be bullying him. We can't leave him alone like this. "
"Ok. But he wouldn't talk to us. What can we do?"
"I will make him talk. Come. Let's go hide over there and spook him when he gets closer. "
"Ah, is that appropriate?"
"Ha, aren't you uptight! Desperate times call for desperate measures. "
"Alright then. "
"Where did he go? Not even a word left for me. Did he forget all about me?"
"Ria. Are you ok?"
"Yeah, I am fine. I think I am going to leave. Maybe I can find Albelt and Adrial somewhere else. "
"Ria, mayhaps it's time to let go. "
"Thank you, but I...Well, maybe I will when I am really tired. Let me walk it off for now."
"Ok, at least let me see you off. "
"No, you should stay here and get your answers from the monks. "
"%s! Wait!"
"Ok. Here it is then. We will meet again. "
"The guardians must be weak after they gave all their energy, but they refuse to let me stay with them. I need to go see Abbot Serenity and ask him to send someone to take care of them. "
"Isn't that %s? How did it go?"
"You are Ria's friend?"
"Yes. Let me introduce you two. This is heir of the Southern Lords. Quite a figure in the middle plains. This is Brooks, aka the Kunlun Giant. He is from the west. "
"He is the Kunlun Giant?"
"Yes. You know him? Nice!"
"I am not sure about that. The Kunlun Giant wrote to challenge the Monastery. Abbot Serenity thought I was with him and called me over to ask about him."
"Oh, ok. This is not how it looks. I am going to the Monastery with him to bring Master Clarion a message. Come along?"
"I need to see Abbot Serenity. Let's go. "
"Hush! I've been waiting for you here. I almost thought they got you!"
"Nearly. Where are Master Clarion and Kegan?"
"Hiding in the Dagobas. Master Clarion is resting. I don't think the monks will come this far yet. When he is rested, let's all head down hill together."
"Ok. Lead me to them. "
"Just a second. Let's find some food first. Everybody is hungry. There are some berries here. Let's get some. "
"Good idea. "
"This should be enough. Oh, it smells delicious!"
"Let's go bring them to Master Clarion and Kegan. "
"Poor thing! I have an idea. Master Clarion was a great monk in life. Now that he's passed, he should be buried in the Dagoba. Let's take him there. "
"Um, let Kegan decide. "
"Kegan is too young to be on his own. Poor kid. Maybe he could go live with my Mom and Dad. What do you think?"
"It would be great if he could learn from their teachings. But your sister..."
"Yeah, she does have a temper. But it's ok, as long as Kegan stays out of her way. And with my parents' protection, the Monastery won't touch him. "
"You underestimate your sister. "
"Don't mind her. My Dad adores young talents. My parents will take good care of him. You and I are both lone travelers. We won't be able to take care of him. "
"True. But again this is up to Kegan. "
"Kegan. I will be off. Here is my bracelet. Take it and go to my parents in River Town. They will give you a home."
"What nerve!"
"What are you doing making a scene in the Monastery! Put down your weapon and leave!"
"I haven't even stepped inside yet and you demand that I put down my weapon?"
"Please, we don't allow weapons here. This is the law here. It's not personal. Please do as we say and leave. "
"Your rule, not mine. "
"Please show some respect! Put down your weapon!"
"Come and take it!"
"I don't put down my weapon just because some strangers tell me to. "
"Stop it! Stop it! We can talk about this!"
"Just you wait!"
"Please, put down your weapon!"
"Take it if you can!"
"But the master is not bullied. "
"I am here. "
"Good. Your master is being bullied and you don't help him?"
"Master is not bullied. It's...just the rules here. No one can be spared when they break a rule. "
"What on earth could someone so kind as your master have done? Wait! Is it because of the Lanka Sutra?"
"Yes, it is. %s, after we asked for your help, we stayed around Mount Hua for awhile longer hoping to find the sutra. But we came back empty-handed. We had no choice but to report it. "
"And take whatever punishment directed your way?"
"No matter what, please put down your weapons first! No one shall carry a weapon or hurt anyone in the Monastery!"
"Don't make me!"
"%s, the Abbot and Master Chastiser have invited you in for a chat."
"Really? Did Master Chastiser finish his urgent business already?"
"No. That's why they want to see you."
"Oh?[Could it be about the volume?] "
"Please follow me. "
"Oh, ok. Thank you. "
"I...won?"
"Nicely done! Brooks is quite a master and you beat him!"
"Thank you. But that was all I know. I would have lost if the fight went any longer. My energy is ample, but my skills are lacking. "
"Sutra of Suns does wonders..."
"%s! Ria!"
"Ria told me everything. How is Master Clarion doing?"
"He seems to be sleeping, but he could be passed out too. I don't know. %s, can you help me?"
"He doesn't look too good. Let me see what I can do. Here, eat some berries."
"I am fine. I am fine. Please help my master. "
"Ok. "
"He's overexerted himself. He has an enormous amount of energy but doesn't really know how to use it. "
"Master! Don't leave me! Ah!"
"Kegan. He is at peace now..."
"Ah! This wouldn't have happened if not for me! He is the only family I have. Ah! "
"Kegan..."
"I should cremate him. I should do him the honors all monks deserve. I should...I should gather some firewood...I should..."
"Let us help you. Kegan, it's ok. "
"This is enough...But would it hurt him, if I cremate him?"
"It's ok, Kegan. He will find peace in fire."
"After the fire, I will never see him again...What if I want to see him?!"
"Kegan, it's ok. This is the right thing to do. The wood is ready. Light the fire now. "
"Yes. You are right. I should be strong. Master would want me to be strong...%s, can you please...Please help me do it. I can't...I can't. "
"Ok. I will do it. It's ok, Kegan. "
"Kegan is still very young and naive. Now that Master Clarion has passed, where will he go?"
"Master, master!"
"Kegan, do you see those Dagobas there? Listen...I know only the most esteemed monks can get to the Dagoba when they pass, but..."
"Master Clarion kept to himself, but was no less great than any of those Abbots. Let's send him to rest in the Dagoba. . "
"In the Dagoba? Yes! Master belongs there. Thank you, Ria. "
"To River Town?"
"Do you want to? Ria is nice. But her sister is really difficult. I am afraid she will put you through pain."
"%s, I can't think now. What do you think? I don't want to be a burden to anyone. But where can I find home now in this world?"
"A real man makes his own home. "
"You're right...I've never left my master's side. Maybe now it's time for me to venture the world alone, like you, %s. You were young too, but you became a hero! I will follow in your footsteps!"
"Good! That's the spirit!"
"Thank you. I shall see what I can do for the world. %s, I hope we will meet again. "
"I should be on my way too. But where..."
"What talent! There is hope for our country yet. "
"Could you state your business here? And why did you hurt our people?"
"We didn't mean to hurt anyone. We were only trying to help Master Clarion."
"Clarion is being punished for breaking the rules. He is not wrongfully charged. Who might you two be? We shall clear everything now. "
"I am afraid this misunderstanding has made me reluctant to share my name at the moment. "
"Ha! What a complex character. Let me get it out of you then. "
"[He is just looking for a way to save the Monastery some face. Let him then. ] Please. "
"Oh, the heir of the Southern Lords. Good child. You've mastered some different types of skills, I see. "
"Thank you. You got me. "
"I've been managing the Arhat Hall for years. Challengers come and go, and I learn from them. %s, what's your business here then?"
"Ria and I came to visit Master Clarion and explain the matter on Lanka Sutra. I also came for a private matter."
"Lanka Sutra is most valuable to us. Clarion is in charge of the Library. He is responsible for its loss. %s, did you mean you found it?"
"I am afraid not. I lost track of the thieves eventually. I came to discuss with Master Clarion on how to proceed further. "
"And what is your private matter?"
"I mean the half of the Volume of War my family was safekeeping."
"Volume of War? Who told you it's in the Monastery?"
"The Inn. "
"They...This is beyond my authority. Let me bring it to the Abbot. Wait here. I will be back. "
"Thank you. "
"Changes will come. And we shall accept it."
"Forgive us for imposing on you as such."
"No. It is me who's imposing. But what is the matter, Abbot?"
"Amitabha. Please read this note. Do you know this person?[Abbot hands you a letter.] "
"A note?[You take the letter and start reading.] "
"It reads: Monastery Monks, you are champions in the Middle Land and the West. The Kunlun Giant is coming to have a taste."
"Do you know this Kunlun Giant?"
"I am afraid not. Who are these people? They sound arrogant."
"How strange. We found this letter by an Arhat Statue. Who could have delivered it there without any of us seeing? "
"Ugh, sounds like you have a mole..."
"Not possible. The statue is four meters high. Nobody in the temple can get up there without a ladder. "
"[These giants must be quite some figure then. But how come I never heard of them before?] "
"Master Chastiser said The Inn sent  you here to look for the half of the Volume of War. Is that so?"
"Yes, indeed. My grandfather left a few men here years ago. Could I meet them?"
"Amitabha. We promised your grandfather. If his heirs lack virtue, the Volume is not theirs; if they have virtue but lack talent, the guardians shall govern them; if they have virtue and talent, the guardians shall await their arrival. "
"Now I've come. "
"With the volume comes great responsibility. You've made a choice then. A choice your grandfather wished you to make. "
"I wish he were here to see me. The burden is heavy..."
"That's why the Volume must pass to capable hands. As promised, we will put you through tests to determine whether you are worthy of the task. Pass those and you shall meet the guardians. "
"Of course. "
"There are three Buddha statues in Puti Hall. Your first test is to ask them for guidance that leads to your next test."
"Medicine Buddha appears unmoved..."
"Gautama Buddha holds a bowl on his left hand. But wait...His small finger is pointing to the right...The Amitabha…"
"This block is hollow..."
"%s, I know you are trying to help Kegan. But if you make a scene here today, the Monastery will never take him back."
"You're joking! They are gonna kill him! And you worry that he won't be able to return to the Monastery again?"
"No. They won't kill him. I won't let them. Master Learning is just being difficult..."
"You are not even sure, are you? He is your senior. You can't persuade him!"
"He has to follow the rules, however senior he is! Kegan served the Monastery well. "
"Too late for that! I will save Kegan."
"Move away!"
"Don't let %s escape!"
"Follow %s! He will lead us to the traitors!"
"I really don't want to do this, but Buddha, forgive %s for desecrating this holy place..."
"That escalated fast! I'd better get out of here. I'll come back and apologize when things quiet down a little. Now, I need to find Master Clarion and Kegan. "
"%s! Over here!"
"…[You move the block and take out an old handkerchief.]  "
"[There is writing on it.] My heir: See the handkerchief and the lotus; May the lotus light shine on my heart. "
"…[You are confused. There is nothing else under the block. You stand up and stare at Amitabha looking for an answer. There it is, the lotus, in his hand. ] "
"Could it be this lotus it's talking about?"
"…[You study the lotus carefully and discover a Lotus Seed in its center. It smells of phosphorite. Open the cover and it will burst into flames.]  "
"Lotus light...Use this seed to light a light? Which one though."
"There is a stone lotus in the pond at the entrance. Might as well go check there..."
"The fated shall overcome."
"Amitabha. You passed the first test. I, Nobody, am to lead you to your answers."
"Thank you, Master Nobody. The reflections of volumes and statues mean...?"
"The Library. That's where the half of the Volume of War is kept. Your grandfather's men have been guarding it for years. If you follow me you can't turn back unless you fail. Have you made up your mind?"
"The volume is not just a national treasure to me. It is what the Southern Lords gave their lives for."
"Amitabha. General Brazen could never have foreseen this. The Volume of War can serve or destroy. It all depends on who has it. %s, follow me."
"Thank you. "
"This is the first stop to the Library, guarded by Stick Monks. Please."
"Thank you, master. "
"I will be waiting at the next stop."
"Masters, please. "
"Heir of the South, %s is here to be tested. We shall do our best."
"Amitabha. You've passed. Your grandfather would be pleased. "
"How many tests did grandfather lay down?"
"It doesn't matter, how many tests you have to go through. It only matters whether you have faith. The real tests are in the Library."
"The guardians. "
"Come with me. There is still some way to go to the Library. We ask all of our disciples who wish to leave to go through the Woodman and Steelman trials. You are not one of the disciples, but you will have to go through this trial none the less. "
"We ask all of our disciples who wish to leave to go through the Woodman and Steelman trials. You are not one of the disciples, but you will have to go through this trial none the less. "
"%s, take care. "
"You were very resourceful."
"They know no pain. The only way to beat them is to sneak attack."
'The Woodmen are dead, but the Steelmen are alive. Both do not know pain and are organized in their attacks. You must find a way to defeat them. '
"Hope I do. "
"Good. The Library is right ahead. "
"Thank you, Master. Without your guidance, I wouldn't have gotten this far. "
"You are much mistaken. It's your wish to guard the volume that's kept you going this far. "
"Honestly, I don't know...Perhaps, I am holding on to it too tight. "
"I understand. The volume has been connected with your whole life. It's only natural to feel attached to it. For better or worse, your complexity will be resolved today. "
"For better, I hope. "
"%s, please don't ask anymore. "
"Master, what is going on?"
"There is a rule in the Monastery. Anyone who learns skills by themselves shall be handicapped. "
"Did you not see how Kegan saved the Monastery's fame for all of you just now?"
"Amitabha. He did serve us well today. But he broke our rule first. Only the Order Hall can decide whether he shall be spared. "
"What if the Order Hall decides he should be punished then? A good young man like him would be handicapped? This is absurd!"
"%s, please!"
"The hearts stay true. "
"The four of us have been guarding the volume for years. We live only to guard the volume. We couldn't even go, when...Please, forgive us!"
"Guardian, I know..."
"The volume is on the top floor. The old master said you must beat all four of us to get it. "
"Grandfather had thought it all through...Ok, then. I will challenge you, old friend. "
"I will not go easy on you. It's the old master's wish. "
"Amitabha. Well done, young master!"
"Thank you. "
"Please go to the second floor. Ansel is waiting to see you. "
"Thank you. I hope we can catch up. "
"We have time. Hurry up now. "
"Ok. Farewell for now. "
"We've waited long and hard for you, young master. "
"Thank you for your service, guardians. "
"Our mission is finally done. Could you let us old bones spend the rest of our time here in the temple? We don't have much use anywhere else now. "
"Of course. You are too kind. I only feel ashamed not being able to look after you here. You are the last of my kin."
"Amitabha...General Brazen's family has fallen. His wish for them is long lost. You should use the Volume to serve the country and justice. He would have liked that."
"I promise. "
"Young master, don't look back. You will face many challenges, if you look back, you will be lost. "
"Amitabha…"
"Amitabha…"
"Ansel greets young master. You look like your grandfather. "
"Deverell is not as harsh as I am. But I hope you don't mind. This is the old master's wish."
"Of course. Please. "
"Haha! Good! Good! Good fight! The South has hope!"
"You are too kind. "
"Sigh...Forgive me, young master. I am just so happy to see you have grown up so well."
"I thank you for all you've done for my family. "
"Old master saved my life and taught me skills. I would do anything for him. You too. "
"Thank you. "
"Bert is waiting on the third floor. Go now. "
"Old master can rest in peace now. "
"Amitabha…Master, your heir is right before me. Young master, please. It's so good to see you here. "
"After you. "
"Please. "
"Amitabha. Young master, you are worthy of your name!"
"Young master, what is loyalty to you?"
"Following those who are righteous and brave but doing so without blind devotion. "
"Good. You know the world is not just black and white. Your experience and wisdom can be relied on."
"I wouldn't have them if I had my family..."
"Fate works in mysterious ways..."
"But at least I still have you guardians. "
"Upstairs, Bishop is waiting. He is the most powerful of the four of us. Good luck. "
"Young master. You are here..."
"Among the four of us, I was closest to old master. When your Four Masters came for help, I was there. And it was me who tended to their wounds. "
"You know my Four Masters!"
"Sigh...But what good did it do? If not for them, old master would not have died. But then, if not for them, you would have died as well. Fate...Young master, let's see how strong you've become. "
"I lost! Old master! Did you see that? You can rest in peace now!"
"I wish grandfather were here to see me grown up. "
"You grew up well, young master. You are worthy of your family name and deciding the fate of the volume. "
"Thank you, guardian. "
"You've passed all the tests. Follow me. Volume of War is in the secret room."
"After you. "
"Now you have the Volume, follow your family's footsteps in safeguarding it. If you can return it to General Brazen's Family, do so. If not, put it to good use."
"Trust me. I won't let this masterpiece go to waste. "
"I am the Kunlun Giant, Brooks. "
"Lanka Sutra? I don't know. I was playing music when I heard fighting. I went to check and saw two men at each others throats. They were both already fatally wounded, but neither would give up. I broke them apart but one died instantly."
"And?"
"I took the other one in and tried to save him. But his wounds were too deep. There was nothing I could do to bring him back. He told me his name was Patton..."
"Wait, what? Was he fighting with Keene then? Lean guy with a corpse face?"
"Yes. How did you know? Patton said he'd done too much wrong and wished to redeem himself. He said he and Keene stole a skill book from the Monastery. Neither of them wanted the other to read it, so they fought to the death."
"All for a book..."
"In the end, he asked me to come to the Monastery and tell a monk named Clarion that the book is in the oil. I felt obligated to come. I was hoping to take a tour around the Middle Land while I was at it too. "
"So you are here to deliver a promise. But how come you sent a battle announcement to the Monastery?"
"That is an entirely different matter. The Western Monks wish to fight me. I thought to invite them over here and get it over with once and for all. "
"What a mess. The Monastery is offended. You are probably the only person who's asked for battle with them. "
"Oh? That's not how you do it? That was rash of me."
"But I am sure if you go explain the matter, it will be fine."
"I've explained everything to %s. You are Ria's friends. I don't want to fight you. "
"No need to be so humble now. Let's see how great the Kunlun Giant is!"
"%s, are you going to say something?"
"Brooks has explained himself. Why are you still pushing this, master?"
"He sends a challenge then backs out! No one slights the Monastery like this. This is none of your business. Don't get invovled. "
"I am afraid I am already mixed up in it. He is Ria's friend. And so he is mine."
"You are a worthy friend! "
"Anything for Ria. "
"So you are close?"
"Not really. But we are both close to a mutual friend. So we get along really well. "
"Ria is a fantastic lady. The first real friend I've ever made. If you get along well with her, you must be quite something too. How about we play a round of chess and get to know each other?"
"Ah...I don't know how to play. "
"Ria is great at it so you must be too. Don't you lie to me. Here, I'll make a board. "
"I am here as demanded. "
"Brooks wishes to share a word with you. "
"I am Clarion. What can I help you with?"
"I will talk to you later. %s, white or black?"
"You drew a board on this stone! What power!"
"Stop it! Stop! You middle landers are too much fuss! I play with you, the monk comes messing. I fight him, you come messing around!"
"Ugh...Only because Master Clarion knows no skills. I am sure you don't want to fight someone skill-less. "
"Impossible! His energy is powerful! He must be a master of skills."
"Trust me. He really is not. "
"Whether or not, let me test it. "
"Brooks! "
"Karma. Karma."
"What do you mean?"
"What's done is done. Kegan is not the monster that slayed your old master. He is a good boy. Is he really to be punished because you can't get over the past?"
"Who are you to say he is good or bad. You can never be sure about people. But you can always be sure about rules. He is not even with the faith just like that monster!"
"So?"
"So? So his mind is not even pure. He could be learning skills in secret today and grow vain tomorrow! Eventually he will turn into a monster!"
"You make no sense!"
"Chew-"
"Please watch over me..."
"Brooks' friend. Nice!"
"Brooks and I are not friends. He left a long time ago. I am afraid you've missed him."
"We are not looking for Brooks. We are looking for the Kunlun people. Even if Brooks were here, we would avoid him."
"What Kunlun people?"
"[He exchanges a look with his men.] Brooks saved someone on Kunlun Mount. That man had a skill book that can make you invincible. He said the book was from the middle land Monastery. So we came. "
"[After Sutra of Suns I see.] What does Kunlun School have to do with this then?"
"So dense! Brooks is one of the most important leaders of the Kunlun School. You think they don't know he came here to fight the Monastery? We are not the only ones who want the book."
"Brooks wouldn't talk. "
"He doesn't. But the disciples might. You know nothing. You are worthless. Let me finish you. "
"Ha! In your dreams. "
"See if it will come true. "
"Yeah. See. "
"You're finished!"
"I'm warning you, don't try anything funny. "
"Like what?"
"This cave echoes. Any sound we make might alert the Kunlun people. You might think they'll save you. But no, they don't want word to get out that they tried to take something that wasn't theirs. "
"So you mean, if I disturb them, I make myself more enemies?"
"Exactly. So be smart and do as I say. "
"Ha. Aren't we fast friends all of a sudden?"
"Don't look funny either. "
"Then don't do anything funny. "
"Desperate times call for desperate measures. Thieves are thieves. We don't need to be all pious about it. You are so weird. "
"I guess you real thieves are better than hypocrites. "
"Whatever..."
"Hush! Someone is coming. Let's hide. "
"Ellis has studied the tank for a while now and still hasn't figured out how to pick the package up. The monks could be coming any moment. How dreadful!"
"Indeed. I really hope we can get that book. Just think, the most powerful skill in the world. If we get it, we will rule the west. "
"Zeze...You have no vision. We are already basically unrivaled in the west. When we have the book, we will rule the Middle Land."
"Haha! Yes. Yes. Let's go to the entrance and watch for monks. "
"Wuuu-"
"Do not make a sound!"
"Listen, do as we say and you will live. I am going to remove my hand now. Don't make a sound!"
"Oh..."
"…[He looks at you, scared and nervous. ]  "
"I'll remove my hand now. Don't make a sound. "
"Hurry! Machetes! Hur-"
"No, you didn't!"
"Ah!"
"Hurry-"
"Now they've been alerted!"
"All praises go to the master of the universe. "
"You must be wondering how you got involved in this mess, right? "
"Of course! Brooks is but an acquaintance. And I know nothing about the Kunlun School. You shouldn't have bothered me. "
"It doesn't matter whether you know about the Kunlun School or not. I saw Brooks fight with you and the two monks. You fight well and your monk friends are even better."
"What's your point?"
"It's a long story. My people have been living under the Kunlun Mount for generations in peace. But recently, invaders have come to disturb us. They know this vicious skill..."
"What skill?"
"A skill that allows them to hurt us without even touching us. We can't get close to them or defend ourselves. We need to find a way to counter this skill...We need to get stronger."
"So you followed Brooks hoping to find that skill book?"
"Yes. We don't necessarily have to have it. It's not ours to have. But we really need it to learn the skills that can help us drive away the invaders. Will you help us?"
"Help you, how?"
"Brooks traveled across the realm to deliver one simple message. There must be something to it. The sutra is in the oil. The sutra must be the skill book. But in the oil, what does that mean?"
"…[This could be my way out!] "
"Young one, think carefully whether you want to pay to keep someone else's secret."
"It's not any oil it means. It means this scripture. Follow me."
"Here?"
"No, chief, deep within the cave. The Kunlun people have posted guards there. We can't get very close."
"Young one, what have you to say?"
"It may or may not be in the cave. That is all I know. There is no reason to hold me any longer. "
"I agree. I know you don't know much, but you've seen us and learned about our business. I am afraid you will have to come with us, just to be safe, in case you run off and tell your bald friends about us."
"Do as you wish then. "
"We don't take innocent lives. Look, the Kunlun School will use the book for good. We will only use it to protect ourselves. And we've set our minds about it. Help me, young one. You don't have any other choice. "
"Fine. "
"We don't know what's it like in the cave. We will head in in groups. You go with Demitri."
"Me? With him?"
"I'll keep my eyes open for a chance to escape!"
"Well done. "
"Chief, we..."
"Never make that mistake again. The good news is that it worked out in our favor. "
"Young one, looks like you know where you stand now. "
"For the time being. What do you mean it worked to your advantage?"
"While they were heading this way, we moved in from behind and took the cave."
"You have the cave?"
"Right about now, actually..."
"...[This one is shadier than he looks.] "
"Chief, please. We have the cave now. "
"Good. Let's go. "
"I said to take the book and slay all the Kunlun disciples!"
"But what if it's not the Sutra of Suns in the oil?"
"Hush...I am only bluffing. It works better than actually killing someone. All you need is for them to fear you. "
"You are a monster. "
"Thank you. I bet he thinks so too. Would you like to talk to him? I am rather nice to my captives. "
"Isn't that awfully good of you?"
"I am afraid it is indeed your business. "
"He is right. The tank is too deep and we don't have any tools that can pick the package up. We can't leave to look for any either, or the monks might hear us. So the only way is for someone to get in and get it. "
"And you mean me."
"Bingo. I want you to go."
"[If it's really Sutra of Suns in there, I will just shout and charge out to bring the Monastery down. They will get what they deserve then!] …Ok. I will go. "
"You must do nothing whilst doing everything. "
"Who are you? Why are you with them?"
"You are Brooks' disciples?"
"Master? You know Master Brooks? Where is he? Get him to come and save us!"
"He left a while ago. He traveled across the realm to deliver a promise and look at you scheming over someone else's possession."
"We don't need your lectures. I am just a disciple. I didn't decide this! The chief did. I am just following orders."
"Do you have no sense of right and wrong then?"
"Here you are lecturing me, when you are here to steal the book too. The tank is too deep anyway. Feel free to take it if you can!"
"It's none of my business who takes it or not. "
"Haha! You really thought we Kunlun disciples are all weaklings? Give me the book or join them!"
"In your dreams!"
"Fine. Just open the package. I want to see whether it really is the Sutra of Suns."
"You didn't have to kill all of them to see!"
"They haven't done anything good in the west. And they always pick a fight with us. They deserve to die. You, on the other hand, we have no bones with. Open it. Don't you want to see what it is?"
"Whether it's Sutra of Suns or not, it belongs to the Monastery. I will give it to Abbot Serenity to open and check. "
"You are so dense! I only want the sutra. If this is not it, then I will leave you be. If this is it, then...then we fight. "
"Ok. Let's see what it is then. "
"I promised Master Clarion I'd get the Lanka Sutra back. Now, I must fulfill my promise so his soul can rest. "
"Tathogata Sutra...Haha. All these warriors and Kunlun disciples have worked for nothing."
"Tathogata Sutra?[Flips through the pages] Nothing...nothing. This is not it!"
"No, it is not. "
"I see. You know what the Sutra of Suns looks like, don't you? It's written all over your face! I can't go back like this. The chief will kill me. You! You have to go with me!"
"And why is that?"
"Why? Because you want to know where the Sutra of Suns is too. Don't you? Don't you want to learn more from Master Brooks?"
"I do actually. Well, lead the way then. "
"Enter Library. "
"Enter Dharma Cave. "
"Medicine, medicine!"
"Master Healer asked me to collect herbs, but the Pangolins are blocking the way. I am so scared of them. Can you help me drive them away?"
"Ok. Wait here."
"Thank you! Now I can go collect herbs!"
"Be careful."
"Have you seen the masked men around the hub? What are they up to? They scare me. Can you drive them away for me?"
"Travelling sons, worrying moms."
"Ah, what to do. What to do? The Altar Guards just won't allow us Song citizens a moments respite! Can you help us out?"
"Thank you. Now we can go back to Song."
"The Guardian's servants robbed us of our cargo. Now we can't go home. Can you help us?"
"Mercy for you all."
"We have some Black Swordsmen bothering us here. Master Sem is too busy handling the plague. We need your help."
"I will help."
"The Temple of Dragons thanks you!"
"It's my pleasure."
"Endlessly, the sand stretches forward..."
"The Desert Lizards are deadly. I can't remember how many we've lost to them. Can you help us slay them?"
"Thank you so much!"
"My pleasure."
"May the Lotus Fire cleanse you."
"The Western Monks pick on us for no reason. Can you help us get rid of them?"
"We traveled long and far to join our Song brothers. But they ignore our cries for help. We need you to help us get their attention."
"Life, it's tough."
"It's getting out of control here. When House Soren was in its prime no one would have dared to bother us. But now there are raiders everywhere. It pains me to say this, but we need help. Would you be able to provide it?"
"A group of masked men has taken over the Tea House. They're causing a grand commotion inside and preventing other people from getting in. Can you help clear them out?"
"I vend goods to House Soren. But lately it's getting more and more difficult to get there because of the Mongols on the way. Can you help me?"
"This shall not be tolerated!"
"Gold Kanet led a group of Mongols uphill. I can't believe they would hurt our pupils! Can you help us punish them?"
"The Taoist School thanks you!"
"I can't believe Master Garrison is working with the Mongols! And there are pupils that follow him in this folly! He must be made an example of."
"What a pity..."
"If only Albelt and Adrial were not master and apprentice...They will never be allowed to be together. Leave now, or receive your punishment!"
"How ridiculous! I will knock some sense into you."
"As you please..."
"That's the spirit."
"Those Mongols!"
"The Mongols turned back! The masters have not got the news yet. We are not ready for battle! Will you help?"
"Could you help me?"
"We've lived here for generations. We've never had much trouble with the Snow Monkeys, but recently they've been getting unusually violent. They come to steal our winter food every night! Could you help me discipline them?"
"The Tomb School's wasps are going berserk. They've stung many of my neighbors. Can you help drive them off?"
"I am a Beggar, but a loner."
"Not every Beggar wants to join the Beggar Sect. I've always been a loner, so I did not. I never thought they would bully me for it..."
"Don't worry. No one will bully you again."
"Thank you. Now I have a place to stay."
"Take care, old pal."
"I just want a quiet place to stay. But these heathens just wouldn't stop making trouble. I am too old for this...Too old."
"Don't worry. I will make them stop."
"Who are those rude monks? What business do they have on our land? Go show them we are not to be bullied!"
"Right away!"
"Haha! Great! See they don't run back home now."
"See if they don't."
"Have you heard about the poisonous spiders in the woods? They are out again biting passers-by! Better go slay them before they hurt more people!"
"Great! One less trouble to worry about."
"As long as we stick together, we can keep the people safe."
"Behave yourself or be disciplined!"
"Lotus Creed took our Dog Cane. %s, despite your relations with them, should you not punish them?"
"I will go see what I can do."
"Thank you for being just!"
"Ramona went to gather our people. %s, let's start handling these Rising Dead before they hurt anyone. "
"Oh, very impressive!"
"You people only know to fight and kill. We hunt to provide for our families. These Mount Hua meddlers won't let us place the traps we need to get our food..."
"You place your traps. Let me handle them."
"Oh, impressive! Thank you! Look how pitiful they are, haha."
"My pleasure."
"We were trying to hunt for deer, but this Snow Jaguar came. I gave up. That thing is gonna eat me alive..."
"Oh, very impressive! Look how it runs!"
"One glance and I am yours for life."
"Albelt asked me to take care of these graves. I would never let anyone disturb them...but I am too weak to fight the Mongol Strays. %s, would you help me?"
"Of course."
"Thank you, %s!"
"We harvest plants. The Frost Wolves harvest us."
"We log wood from the hill and sell them to the rich households for money. But this year, there have been too many Frost Wolves uphill preventing us from felling the trees..."
"Thank you so much! Now we can survive the winter!"
"The road is blocked. Turn back!"
"The elder has ordered this road be blocked. You may pass after the duel, but not before. Turn back right now!"
"What a blockhead!"
"Ouch...Ok, ok!"
"That'll teach you to be so insufferable!"
"I don't know who to believe."
"%s, I misjudged you! You've murdered the Ten Elders and you will pay for what you did!"
"I told you this is all a misunderstanding!"
"We were wrong..."
"As long as you know now."
"I am glad the truth is out now. But as for the Earth Fighters, well, they still follow Rai, even though he's been had. We need to teach them some sense!"
"Yes, we do."
"Fight to learn and grow. "
"The masters say you are the Monastery's friend. The four guardians in the Library are your kins. And they say you are quite a figure in the swordsman world. Can I please challenge you to learn?"
"Of course.  "
"That was great! Thank you. "
"Thank you. "
"Answer to no name. For we are one. And one we are. "
"Woodman Lane and Steelman Lane are the toughest trials the Monastery gives to its disciples. Since you are here, why not try your hand?"
"Thank you for this opportunity.  "
"Please bless us."
"Come on, show me your Effects. See if I can beat them. "
"One day, one day I will beat your Effects!"
"Maybe, we will see. "
"Why is there no Puti Tree in Puti Hall?"
"Wow, a real hero is here! %s is here! Could you please share some of your adventures with us? No? Heng. I dare you. You are just a bluff, aren't you? I dare you fight with my brothers in Arhat Hall!"
"How rude! Well, I take you dare!"
"Wow! Master %s! Look what you did! You are so great!"
"You are flattering me.   "
"The rules make it work. "
"Not all brothers are allowed to learn skills. We at Order Hall have to watch our Dharma Hall brothers practice everyday. But we never get to learn anything ourselves. Maybe you could have a friendly fight with them, so we could have some fun? "
"That was brilliant. Thank you!"
"My pleasure. "
"Another challenger? Nice!"
"Please go easy on me."
"This is the Dreamworld. Your love will be tested here."
"Albelt, look at these two."
"Try It (Open Instance)"
"Your power is undeniable!"
"Thank you, Instructor General."
"Are you ready? There is no turning back! Watch out for the ambush!"
"The Jurchens ambushed us! Heroes, help us break through!"
"Good you are here. The Jurchens are coming strong. Come help!"
"Right away!"
"Let's break through!"
"Vita is combination of the five elements. Know how to work your vita, and you will find power."
"Here you are. Fairfax has told me everything. Please."
"If you insist against our Taoist School, we will have to use the Astral Move on you!"
"Thank you for coming. We must succeed!"
"My pleasure. Where do you want me?"
"Everyone take care!"
"No surprise is a surprise during an escort. "
"My family has been in the escort business for generations. We are famed for fast and safe delivery.  "
"Let me tell you a good story..."
"When Emperor Hui of Han was in power, the realm was in its prime. Many nations brought tribute to our court."
"A taoist called, Han Zhi came from over the sea."
"As well as a giant from Neali in the east."
"The Neali giant had horns on his head and fangs instead of teeth. From the waist down he was covered in fur. There was no telling how old he was."
"Emperor Hui asked of Han Zhi: Han Zhi, you know many foreign languages, ask the giant how old he is and what he has seen. Han Zhi went to the giant and asked."
"The giant answered: The circle of life runs on forever. You die and you are born again. There is no telling how many years and generations I have lived."
"Emperor Hui sent Han Zhi to ask him about Nuwa. The giant answered: Before the snake woman there were already wind, seasons and people as they are now."
"Emperor Hui sent Han Zhi to ask him about Suiren Shi."
"He answered:Before those times the people were kind and moral. But they became vain and greedy. Wars were started and morality was lost."
"Han Zhi brought the answers to Emperor Hui. The Emperor pensively replied: To learn of history so long before our time is a truly rare blessing."
"Han Zhi considered the Emperor's comments. He himself withdrew into a period of contemplation."
"In the Jin dynasty, there was a young man called Xing Ling. He never talked much. And he never grew mad, even when people bullied him. His father and brothers thought he was a simpleton."
"They asked him to look after the crops. But he wouldn't stop the cows when they came to eat the crops. Only after they finished would he go to tend to the ruined crops."
"His father grew mad. But he said: We are all created equal in this world. If cows want to eat the crops, why shouldn't they?"
"His father scowled at him and said: Then why did you tend to them afterwards?"
"Xing Ling answered: The crops are creatures too. They are hurt. So I help."
"The local official commanded the villagers to make a ship. Everyone was ordered to turn in one pair of oars. Xing Ling made a pair, but before he could turn them in, they were stolen."
"Curiously, the thief that stole the oars began to feel a sense of incurable guilt and anguish. Xing Ling saw him and asked: Was it you who stole my oars?"
"The thief would not answer. But his anguish grew worse. Xing Ling said: A truth left unspoken will eat you up inside until you're all but dead."
"The thief cracked and acknowledged his crime. Xing Ling brought him some well water. He drank it and his heartache was gone."
"When ship was finally assembled, it's oars all collected, the villagers tried to launch it into the water, but it wouldn't move. Only when Xing Ling pushed its tail did it start moving. Other such curious events followed. Soon everyone started seeing Xing Ling in a remarkably different light."
"A young lady had been sick for years and was dying. Xing Ling came and sprayed her with water he had personally drawn from a nearby well. She regained health."
"Xing Ling visited an old lady who had been paralyzed for dozens of years. He sat with her for some time, in silence. After quite some time he stood up and said to the lady's son: Help her up."
"The son replied, somewhat scornfully: But mother has been paralyzed for dozens of years. She can't get up. Xing Ling insisted: Try now, he said."
"Still skeptical, the son did as Xing Ling suggested. When she was up, Xing Ling asked the son to move away. Incredibly, the lady stood and started walking on her own. "
"A young man's house was haunted. He would hear strange, disembodied conversation at night. Objects in his house would appear to move of their own accord. Despite placing many exorcising charms about the house, these strange phenomenon would not abate."
"Xing Ling came to his house, saw the charms and said: One cannot fight fire with another type of fire. He asked the man to destroy all the charms. After which the house was no longer haunted."
"Before long people from the neighboring villages were coming to him for help too."
"Xing Ling was a very gentle and polite soul. He would bow to everyone he met and humbly introduce himself."
"When he saw a broken branch or withering grass, he would bury or straighten them. When he saw a toppled object on the road, he put it back in place."
"This kindness he showed to everyone and everything touched the gods and they granted him powers."
"During the Northern Wei there existed on the main road, not far from here, a virtually derelict courtyard."
"A hermit, Zhao Yi, claimed to have been born in the Jin dynasty and thus could remembered everything from that time."
"One day, on his way to the capital, he passed this courtyard and exclaimed: I remember this place. It was once a royal temple in Jin times."
"No one believed him, and those who might have believed him said there was no way of proving what he said was true, on account of the loss of many records from that era. He answered, knowingly: This courtyard was once a temple with three pagodas."
"He pointed at the open ground and said: It was right here. The owner, keen to prove the mad hermit wrong and be rid off him, dug up the area, only to find, to his surprise, thousands of bricks, each with inscriptions detailing their time and use."
"The doubters were in awe and called him a saint."
"The owner donated the yard and it's content on the condition it be rebuilt into the temple it once was. Many people wanted to know more."
"Zhao Yi indulged their curiosity: There were few people in this area. But the lords' houses looked much like they do now."
"He would go on: I have lived through the reigns of sixteen Emperors. In the last two hundred or so years, I have toured the capital at regular intervals."
"Even if the books of history still existed today, they could not have contained in them the many nuances of this city, and it's society, that I experienced by living in it myself. It wasn't all glorious, you know; there was a dark side: blaming faults on others and the base thievery of the contributions of others was commonplace."
"Deceits of the worse kind. Many people were just bad drunks. Others were accustomed to killing and slaughter. Many of those you've been taught to revere were not perfect. They schemed. They staged bloody coups. They malgoverned."
"We all believe that which has passed is good, the present and the available is not. We all believe what the books say. We believe that those living are without virtue and only the dead are truly wise."
"Some asked him how it came to be this way. To which he replied: When someone dies, even if the nicest thing you could have said of them was that they aspired to be nothing more than mediocre, nice things will still be written on his tombstone. Few of these amount to more than imagined stories."
"If a king, they would say he was the greatest king to have ever lived; if  a minster, they would say he did the realm a great service; if a local officer, they would say his integrity could not be rivaled."
"To manipulate the facts and praise someone undeserving is to corrupt a base integrity, to disrespect true honor. This put many writers at the time to shame."
"A guard came to Zhao Yi and asked: This pagoda in front of the mayor's office looks rather old. Perhaps you know a thing or two about it?"
"Zhao Yi answered: It was built in 416 by the factions that opposed Yao Hong. One of the lords asked Zhao Yi how he managed to live for so long."
"Zhao Yi said: I have never made an effort to lengthen my life. My natural life I have determined through divination is intended to be five hundred years. As of this moment, I have half of that remaining."
"Such became Zhou Yi's fame that the emperor would parade him around the capital, where he would speak about the history of the city. Three years later, he suddenly disappeared. Neither hide nor hair has been seen of him since."
"In Tang dynasty, there was a commoner called, Shou Yi. He sold medicine for a living."
"Those who asked him for medicine and were turned down, soon died; those who he insisted upon giving medicine to, soon developed serious illnesses."
"A rich man had only one son. When the son turned 16, a strange mass grew between his eyebrows."
"No one could remove it. The rich man begged Shou Yi to come help."
"Shou Yi lit an incense, and requested a feast as if he was honoring something. He chewed a pill and smeared it on the mass."
"Soon, the mass broke. From it crawled out a tiny colorful snake. The snake fell to the ground and grew 10 feet long."
"Shou Yi sat at the feast, drank all the wine and called to the snake. The snake flew into the air and the sky turned black."
"Then the snake flew over and carried Shou Yi away."
"Li Zimou was a charming royal prince. He played the flute with a grace and splendor that none could match."
"One the day of Lantern Festival, when the people came out of their houses to the river banks to see the lanterns,"
"Zimou was out too. He said to his friends: Let me play the flute. It would make everyone stop and listen. His friends believed so too."
"Zimou climbed to a high window and started playing. The music was indeed so fine that people stopped what they were doing and started listening."
"Zimou exulted in his triumph. The atmosphere of awe was broken only by an old man stepping off a boat that had quietly reached the bank where Zimou was performing. The old man was humming a strange melody. He had the effortless air of someone that almost demands respect."
"The Old Man said to Zimou: Was it you that was playing? You play well, but your flute is far too ordinary."
"Zimou answered: This flute was given to me by the former emperor. It could only be the best among flutes."
"I've seen thousands of instruments in my lifetime, but never anything so fine as this flute. Yet, you say it's ordinary. May I ask why?"
"Old man said: I started to play the flute when I was little. I still play now. I have never seen a flute as poor as this. Would you allow me to demonstrate?"
"Zimou gave the flute to him. The Old Man played it. He produced a sound that instantly shattered the flute."
"People all around were so shocked. Zimou fell to his knees, inconsolable about his flute."
"The Old Man said: I am afraid you wouldn't be able to play any of my flutes. He took one out for Zimou to see. It was made of white jade."
"Zimou tried in vain to produce a sound from it. He felt embarrassed.."
"The Old Man took the flute back. He set it to his lips and began to play: Let me play a song for you."
"While Zimou's music had been beautiful, the Old Man's was heavenly, carrying with it the flavor of more than just raw human talent."
"As the music went on, the winds picked up. Clouds moved in. Ripples in the river grew into waves. And the sky darkened. The song went on for what seemed like years. When finally it ended the sky appeared as it had before the Old Man started playing. The darkness lifted, the clouds gone. And so was the old man and his boat. No one ever knew where he went."
"Years ago, a Taoist master stopped to rest at an inn."
"A young farmer, Lu Sheng, came and settled down beside him."
"Lu Sheng was great at conversation. But after talking for a while, he looked down at his shabby clothing and suddenly felt himself rather inferior. He said: Unimaginable that a man such as myself should fall so low."
"The Master said: You are strong and healthy, witty and knowledgeable. Why would you feel melancholy?"
"Lu Sheng said: I do not feel like I am living life; I feel like I am only surviving. There is no comfort or joy. So the Master asked: What is comfort to you then?"
"Lu Sheng answered: Comfort is fame and a great career. Comfort is the finest food and music. Comfort is power and wealth. Comfort is sons and alliances."
"For years I have applied myself, but to this day I am still a poor farmer. His dejection and the wine soon made him sleepy."
"The Taoist master took out a porcelain pillow for Lu Sheng and said: Use this when you sleep at night and you will have comfort."
"The pillow was hollow and had two holes on the ends. Soon Lu Sheng fell asleep and started dreaming. In his dream the holes became doors big enough to walk through. Lu Sheng walked through the holes and found his way home."
"He married a beautiful wife. She gave him many sons. Their life became better and better."
"The next year, he won top place in the official government examinations and took office as a construction supervisor."
"Three years later, he was promoted. He opened aqueducts in his jurisdiction and became popular and respected by his people."
"Further promotions eventually led to a summons to serve in the Capital."
"During the war, he was assigned to act as Royal Envoy."
"He planned carefully, fought bravely and led the army to victory. He built three strongholds for the realm. Under his protection, the borders remained secure, and peace and prosperity reigned. His name was inscribed in many places of dedication. Back in the capital, he was promoted to serve within the highest echelons of power at court."
"But as he climbed higher, his enemies grew more jealous. Rumors were spread about him and he was eventually demoted and banished."
"Three years later he was called back to serve at court."
"For ten years, he worked without reserve and made policies that changed thousands of lives. But again he was caught in political maneuvering and placed in prison."
"There he remained for many years. When his wife came to visit him, he held her hands and cried."
"He would say: I was from Shandong province. I had lands at home and I could support myself well. I regret dreaming about taking office and gaining power. Look at me now. Never will I be able to return to those simple pleasures."
"He took out a knife and tried to slit his own throat. His wife stopped him. At trial he was spared from execution. He was released, but his titles, office and wealth were taken from him. And once again he was banished from the Capital."
"Years later, the emperor realized how he had wronged him and brought him back to the Capital. He became the emperor's most trusted minister. No one could rival him."
"He had five sons. All of them of excellent character who, like him, rose to important office."
"They all married well with other powerful families in the realm. He had dozens of grandsons."
"He had the finest lifestyle. He had the prettiest singers in his house. He had vast lands."
"He grew old and tired. He wrote to the emperor to resign from office. The Emperor wouldn't release him from service. He grew sick from overwork and old age. The best doctors from all over the realm visited him, bringing with them the best, most expensive medicines."
"When death seemed inevitable, he wrote to the emperor to say goodbye and to thank him for the favor he had shown him in life."
"He wrote that: Now it's time for me to leave your service. This I cannot help."
"I will forever remain grateful for the favor you have shown me. But I must at last bid you goodbye."
"The emperor thanked him for his service."
"And insisted on having him see another doctor. He hoped he would still recover."
"But on that very night, he passed. As he died in the dream, he woke up in reality."
"He found himself still lying in the inn with the Taoist master sitting next to him. His cup as full as he had left it. "
"He realized it was just a dream and exclaimed: It was merely a dream!"
"The taoist master smiled and said: But it felt real, didn't it? Lu Sheng nodded in agreement."
"He said: This dream showed me what life really is, and what in life is really important. I will never forget your teachings. At which the Master smiled, bowed, and finally left."
"Jiang Ji was a general. One day his wife dreamed of their dead son. In the dream, she found her son crying. When she asked what was the matter her Son replied: Mother, I am suffering in the underworld. I can't bear it anymore. I am as tired in death as I was in life. I cannot let this go on."
"’I need you to help me. Go West, to the temple, to the man they call Sun Ke. His time to die is nearly upon him. He is looked on favorably here. Can you tell father to talk to him for me? When he gets here, maybe he will help me.‘ The Mother woke up and told Jiang Ji about the dream. But he didn't believe it to be anything more than a dream and soon forgot about it."
"The next day, the mother had a similar dream. The son said: Sun Ke is coming. I stole a second to come here. He will pass at noon. I won't have another chance. Can you please tell father again? For me?"
"In order to convince Jiang Ji, he described Sun Ke to his mother. She told the dream to Jiang Ji and convinced him to at least see whether there was such a man."
"Jiang Ji sent men to ask about Sun Ke around the temple. Eventually, they did find a man matching his son's description. Jiang Ji broke into tears and said: My son, I was so wrong. I nearly ruined your life down there! He went to see Sun Ke and asked him to help his son."
"Sun Ke was happy to learn he was favored in the underworld, even though it, of course, meant he would have to die to enjoy it. He promised to help Jiang Ji's son get a better position."
"Jiang Ji went back home and arranged men to keep posts at the temple. Around noon, news came that Sun Ke had a sudden heart attack and died."
"Jiang Ji cried and said: My son did the right thing to come to me. A month later, the mother had another dream in which her son, appearing again to thank her, looked well and happy."
"Lou Shide was always sickly. One day a purple robed man visited him in his dream and asked whether he would travel with him somewhere."
"Shide had felt such strength in this mysterious robed man's presence that he immediately agreed. He walked with the man for miles, eventually coming to a grand building with big red gates and guarded by unusually tall men."
"The Purple Robed Man said: This here is the building of the dead. Shide was shocked and said: But how is it here in the world of the living? It looks very alive. The man said: The underworld and the world of the living are connected. Few people know this."
"The guards stepped aside and the Purple Robed Man stepped in with Shide following. Inside they walked to a room clearly marked with a sign that read [Fates]. The Robed Man said it contained the records of every human who ever lived and who will ever live."
"Shide saw thousands of volumes on the desks neatly arranged around the room. A man in a green robe sat vigilantly nearby. Shide was curious. He asked to look at his own record. He was given one of the hefty volumes which he flicked through until he found his own record."
"His record detailed the date and place of his taking high office. It also said he would live until he was 85. He was very pleased and said to the green robed man: I never thought I had such a good fate."
"Suddenly a loud drumming sound came from above and shook the ceiling. The green robed man said: This is the Drum of the Heavens. You must go right now. Shide woke and remembered it was a dream."
"It was dawn, and the temple near his house was sounding the morning drum. His sickness went away that day and later he took high office just as recorded in his book of fate."
"Later he was given high office in the Navy. One day, though, a yellow robed man came to his house and addressed him: I am a messenger from the underworld. I am here to take you away."
"Shide was shocked: But I saw the record of my fate. I will live to be 85 and be promoted again. Why are you here for me now?"
"The yellow robed man said: Your fate was not fixed. In the course of your life you have taken the lives of innocents. This was never part of your written fate. And for this we have decided to change your fate. We will take your life now."
"At that moment Shide lost his sight. Three days later, he passed."
"During the Tang dynasty, Empress Wu Zetian dreamed of a parrot with broken wings. When she woke she asked her advisers what it could mean. Not one of them would say a word."
"That is, not one except Di Renjie. He said: Your two sons are far away from Court. Should you bring them back, I'd wager the parrot's wings will not be broken when you dream of it again."
"The queen's nephews, ambitious young men, heard this and became worried. Later, the border towns that the young royal princes were visiting came under attack from barbarians."
"Wu Zetian dreamt of the parrots with broken wings again. She realized Di Renjie's interpretation might have some validity. She announced: I wish to assign an heir. This will require the presence and counsel of my sons. But who should I choose to succeed me?"
"Di Renjie said: You have outstanding sons and nephews. But who you pick should be your own decision."
"Wu Zetian said: I believe it will be one of my sons that I shall choose. My nephews, while ambitious, have not the talent of my sons. The Empress' nephews heard this and fled."
"Wu Zetian made the royal prince, Li Dan, her heir. A popular general and of good character, Li Dan's appointment was a great boon to the nation. Many clamored to join the army. Under Li Dan the nation remained secure and peaceful."
"Wang Bo was a low-ranking official of small importance in the town of Yang Zhou. He had no family of his own, and no friends except for an acquaintance who was an army officer, who would occasionally offer him food and hospitality."
"During the Dragon Boat Festival one year, Wang Bo's town was unusually busy, even considering the festivities."
"Thousands of people had come to enjoy the festivities with their loved ones. Everyone was enjoying themselves. Everyone except Wang Bo. He had no one. He felt lonely."
"Thankfully, his generous friend, the army officer, came by and invited him to go to his house and drink with them. He gratefully accepted the invitation."
"The officer brought a bottle of wine. Soon Wang Bo had drunk almost all of it."
"He fell asleep and dreamed of a big feast. He was sitting at the head of the feasting table. And he could see that many lower rank officials sat below him."
"He woke up but chose not to tell anyone about the dream. To Wang Bo's surprise, he was, not long after, promoted on account of the premature death of a superior."
"Wang Bo started to worry. Was this how it was in the dream, too? He could not remember exactly. He mentioned it to his staff: I dreamed I became a minister. Much of what has happened to me recently also happened in the dream..."
"Days later, Wang Bo received an official summons, including to both his dread and joy, a promotion: a promotion to the rank of minister. He planned a celebratory feast nonetheless. It was only when he finally sat down to enjoy it that he realized it was exactly as it was in his dream."
"Huang Puhong ranked first in the local official examinations. He success galvanized his ambition to move on to the provincial exam. He became cocky. So cocky did he become, in fact, that he got drunk on the day of the exam, offended the royal supervisor, and was ultimately kicked out of the exam room."
"He was disgraced, but resolved to take the exam in a different province. His planned was ruined when he learned that the very same royal supervisor would be supervising the exams there too. He knew he would  fail, so he gave up and turned back to go home."
"On the way, he had a dream. His wife's dead nanny, of all people, came to him and asked: Why are you walking home? You should go take the exam. He told her his concerns. She said: You should go ask for a blessing from the Stone Goddess."
"She led him to a little cabin somewhere far off the main road. Inside the cabin there was a stone woman. Huang Puhong knelt to honor her."
"The nanny said: This here is my little one's husband. He is going to take an exam. Goddess please tell us whether he can pass it. The Stone Goddess nodded and said: He will."
"The nanny said to him: the Stone Goddess said you will pass it. Come back to honor her after you have achieved your success. Huang Puhong knelt and thanked them. The nanny took him back to the inn."
"He woke up. So real had the dream felt that Puhong decided to go ahead with the exam anyway. He went back. The royal supervisor did recognize him."
"The supervisor didn't want the other examinees to think he was petty, so he allowed Puhong to take the exam , but decided that afterwards he would mess with Puhong's papers."
"When the scores were released, he planned to cross off Huang Puhong's name. But when Puhong's name turned out to be the one at the very top the supervisor couldn't decide what to do and so decided to leave it for the morning."
"The next day, he asked his family to pick out the best paper from the exam for him. They picked Huang Puhong's paper. The supervisor saw it and sighed: There's someone looking out for this boy."
"He decided not to mess with Huang Puhong's scores and Huang Puhong's name remained at the top. On the way back home, Huang Puhong stopped at the inn where he had dreamed of the Stone Goddess. He felt conflicted. He knew he should thank the Stone Goddess, but did not know how he could possibly find her again."
"The Innkeeper heard Huang Puhong quietly muttering to himself about this. He laughed and said: Sounds like you had the blessing of the Stone Goddess. Many people stop by here to ask for her blessing. I remember you from a few days ago. The Stone Goddess statue is close to here. Three miles or so away . I can show you later."
"Huang Puhong was glad to hear this. He brought wine and meat and followed the owner to the Stone Goddess. It looked just as it had in the dream. He knelt, honored her with the meat and wine, and thanked her, before finally going on his way."
"Li Shu was gifted in the arts of war. He conquered many new lands for his country, but nevertheless ruled over those he conquered with mercy and integrity. He never punished an innocent man. The people loved him. Even his enemies respected him."
"One autumn he was called back to the capital to be promoted. On the way, one of his guards had a dream. In the dream they were crossing the Tianjin bridge, the dreaming guard was the one heading the procession."
"All of sudden, eight Taoists came charging by on horses  attempting to cross the bridge from the other end. The guard yelled at them to make way for Minister Li Shu."
"The Taoists said: We are here to welcome Master Li Shu. We know nothing of a Minister Li Shu. One Taoist called to the nearest guard and said: I am going to tell you something. Remember my words and tell them to Li Shu."
"Then he said: Power in this world is fleeting and of little consequence compared to what comes after."
"The guard had to repeat it several times before he memorized it. Once he had memorized it, the Taoists left."
"The guard woke up in a cold sweat. He passed on the dream message to Li Shu, who was unimpressed and dismissed it as nocturnal fantasy."
"Three days later, when Li Shu's procession crossed the Tianjin bridge, the guard was, as in the dream, heading the procession. Off to the side of the bridge he noticed eight Taoists. They watched the procession pass, but did not say a word. A month later, Li Shu passed away."
"Many were shocked by his sudden death. The guard was one of the few that eventually realised the significance of this event. Li Shu, he mused, had never belonged in this world. His talent and integrity was not that of a mortal. The guard knew that he had once walked in the presence of a god."
"The westerners built the Puti Temple. In it there were some graves. One day a monk went to dig a grave for bricks and dug out a living person."
"The queen thought it a bad omen and asked the minister: Are things like this common?"
"Minister said: They dug out a house slave dozens of years ago. It's not uncommon. The queen asked the minister to question the living person."
"He said: My name is Cui Han. My parents live in the west side of town. When I died I was 15. Now I am 27. I lived for 12 years under the ground. Most of the time, I was lying there as if I was drunk. Sometimes I got up to look for food and drink, as if I was sleep walking. All of it is a blur."
"The minister sent men to investigate his story and found his parents. They asked the father: Do you have a dead son?"
"The father said: My son's name was Cui Han. He died when he was 15. The men said: He was dug out of the ground days ago. He has come back to life."
"The father was scared and took back what he said: I do not have any sons. I was lying. The men brought Cui Han home anyway. The father lit a fire to keep him away and held a knife against him. The mother used a wooden cane to stop him from entering the house."
"The father said: Do not come in! I am not your father. You are not my son. Get out of here. We don't want profane creatures in our house! Cui Han had no choice but to leave. He started wandering the streets and sleeping by the temple gate."
"The lord heard about this and gave him a set of yellow clothes. Cui Han didn't like sunlight. He couldn't look up to the sky. He was afraid of fire and knife. When he walked, he walked very fast. And he would rest whenever he was tired. Some believed he was neither alive nor dead. A ghost."
"On a whim, one day Cui Han visited a coffin shop and asked them not to use Sang wood on the heads of the coffins."
"When asked why, he said: When I was down there, I remember the underworld guardians would take the souls of those buried in Bo Wood headed coffins, but did not take the ones with Sang wood at the heads of their coffins."
"After this, Bo wood's price tripled. Some believed the coffin shop owners bribed Cui Han to say so."
"There was a young man called Ma Zi in Jin dynasty. He was sleeping in the stable one day and had a dream. In the dream there was an eighteen year old girl."
"She claimed she was the daughter of a mayor, and that she had passed four years ago. Her premature death, she said, was a mistake, as according to her 'record of fate' she should have lived to the age of eighty."
"She continued, saying that the underlord had agreed to give back her life. But, because she was fated to be Ma Zi's wife, she needed his help to come back to life."
"Ma Zi agreed to help and they set a day to meet again. On the day agreed, Ma Zi found hair at the foot of his bed. He asked the maids to sweep it away, but the hair returned, piled thicker than before."
"He realized it must be the girl from the dream. He sent away the servants and the girl finally revealed herself. He let her sit on the bed. They spent the night together."
"She kept telling him: My body is still too weak. When Ma Zi asked when can she could fully return to the realm of the living, she said: On the day of my birthday."
"When her birthday was close, she told Ma Zi where he could find her coffin and how he would be able to bring her back to life. On the day of her birthday, Ma Zi used a red cockrel, a bowl of yellow rice, and a bottle of clear wine to honor her in front of the stable."
"Afterwards, he opened her coffin and found her fresh and alive. He put her on the bed. She felt warm, but her breathing was still feeble."
"Ma Zi had four maids attend to her and kept dripping black lamb's milk on her eyes. Soon, she opened her mouth and could eat porridge. After a few months, she could walk with a cane. A year later, she was just as any healthy girl."
"Ma Zi's family sent word to her family. The entire household came to visit her. Soon, she and Ma Zi were married."
"They had two boys. Both of them took high office later in life."
"They also had a daughter, who went on to marry into a prominent family."
"Wei Feng in Tang dynasty was a loner. His hobby was to tend to his garden."
"One day, one of his servants found human hair when trimming the grass. He dug deeper and found more hair. The strands looked soft and fresh."
"Wei Feng was intrigued and dug deeper into the ground, soon he found a woman's head. Her skin and flesh looked just like a living girl's. He dug deeper and discovered her whole body. While her body was a fresh and alive as her face and hair, the clothes she had been wearing were almost completely decayed."
"Gradually the girl regained strength and stood up. She thanked Wei Feng and claimed to be a maid for his ancestors. She had been punished in this manner because she had offended the mistress."
"After burying her alive, the mistress made up a story saying she had run away. Nobody came to look for her."
"She said: After I had died I recall two black robed men taking me to a grand temple. There I saw the lord of underworld. He asked the men what happened to me."
"They told him. I was so afraid. Even in death I was too afraid to accuse the mistress of murder. Then they led me to the Office of Fate. I'd never seen so many books in one place."
"One of them asked for my name and checked my book. He said I should not have died yet. For her crime he said he would take eleven years of my mistress's life and give them to me."
"I cannot recall why, but I think the judgement of the officer was overruled. I waited a very long time for them to come to a new decision."
"Just yesterday, many years ago as you living people count it, a new judge was transferred to the underworld. He picked up my case. There were many just like me. But our social status was so low, so no one thought of us."
"That judge looked like a Taoist. He wore a red robe and hat. As soon as he reviewed my case, he granted that my life be returned to me, on account of my former mistress already have passed away herself."
"Wei Feng asked: But how did your body not decay? She answered: For those with an unfinished case or suspended judgment, officers in the underworld use a special potion to keep the bodies from decaying."
"Wei Feng found the young woman rather curious. He asked her to take a bath and change clothes. She looked just as the other girls in their twenties. After taking her in, she told him many things about the underworld in private conversation."
"After the stories, he would inevitably say: We should all do good and the gods will reward us."
"Several years later, Wei Feng and the maid disappeared together. No one knew where they went. Wei Feng's family found a diary. From first page to last, the diary was full of stories. All manner of weird and wonderful stories told to him by the strange young woman he had found buried in the garden."
"There was a general, called Wang Mu. His army lost the battle and he was riding to retreat."
"The enemy caught up with him and cut his throat. His head was almost completely severed. He died instantly and fell off the horse."
"At first, he didn't realize he was dead. It didn't come to him for a while. When he did realize, he saw his head resting on his belly button and felt sad."
"He felt food coming out from his severed neck, so he held up his head and put it back on his neck. It fell off. And he passed out again."
"He woke up after a long while and put his head back on again. He tried to hold it there with his hair and sat up. He felt lost. He didn't know whether he could survive this and come back to life."
"His horse stayed with him. It saw him sit up and came to stand in front of him. Wang Mu used its legs to help pull himself up. But his hair loosened and his head fell off again. He passed out and woke up again at midnight."
"He put his head back and tied his hair around it again. He thought: I can't get on the horse, unless it kneels down. And the horse knelt down in front of him. He got on the horse and it carried him to the south east. He held his head with his hands and rode like that for 40 miles."
"His soldiers saw him and came to him. They took him to a nearby village. But it was still too close to the enemy camp. Soon, they carried him to another general's camp."
"200 days later, he recovered. Around his neck, a circle of bulged flesh grew and his head was a little tilted. But he recovered."
"The lord appreciated his valor and service and gave him a good post which he held till his death."
"Welcome, welcome! This way please!"
"It's crowded in the hall. Are there private rooms available?"
"Sorry, we don't have any private rooms available. But with 500 Gold, I can certainly offer you double gains. Interested?"
"Ugh, 500...is a little too much."
"Sure. Here is 500 Gold."
"Bandits here! Heroes, get them!"
"Useless bunch of servants can't even get me a private room! To stay with all these horrible people...!"
"You want me to drink this? Sorry. It would make me sick. You, go get some Silver Needle for me!"

"I...I really admire Miss Shirley. I am so glad to see her here. I just picked this Daisy for her. Can you...give it to her for me?"
"Ok..."
"What is this?"
"Please, he just wants to show you he cares about  you."
"Private rooms are quiet but here in the hall, it's more real."
"Mayor, please!"
"What a pleasure to be drinking tea with the Mayor himself!"
"The Story Teller has done really well today. Here give him these silver for me as a tip."
"You are so generous."
"Thank you. Here for your trouble."
"Thanks."

"Nuts, eggs, tea..."
"Cigarettes..."
"Tea and desert."
"If you liked it, please give me a few coins. I will really appreciate that."
"%s just gave a handsome tip!"
"What's the fun in listening to an old man? Come watch us dance."
"Want to pick a song?"
"Sure, what about I Need Your Love?"
"You are so naughty."
"Haha."
"%s, long time no see. I heard you've been doing well!"
"Mayor, I see you are having some easy fun while Koen is running around protecting the city."
"Eh, just a quick drink. Come join me?"
"No, thank you. I might get sick."
"Richman, please."
"You are too kind. Without your donations, I would never have achieved anything."
"Nothing but reading is worth doing ."
"What are you doing here then?"
"Parry, lighten up. You two don't belong together. Maybe there is someone better in your books."
"Love hurts. My heart is filled with hurt."
"I must report the Mayor for neglect of duty."
"Great! I support you!"
"This is a rough time for us wolves!"

"Get out of our place!"
"I will sting you!"
"You won't survive tonight, ha!"
"Did you come to feed me?"
"I will look so much better after eating you."
"Take this!"

"Aren't you too young to be a soldier?"
"Look at that new kid. Looks so weak!"

"How useless! Can't even beat a new kid."
"A powerful one. Come let's fight."
"I admit you are special!"
"Some heir I hear. Don't know if that one is any good though."
"We want to serve the country just as much as General Brazen did."
"We are doing our best, but the king..."
"The king keeps begging for a truce. We can't be more disappointed."
"Kid, try me."
"Come, I will play."
"Come, let's have a fight."
"No one has ever been able to take an attack like this."
"No whining. "
"We will show you how good we are."
"Impressive."
"Come, let's have a good fight."
"Let me see how powerful you are."
"How impressive. Let me try your hand."
"Beat by a kid."
"A newbie got me..."
"You are brilliant!"
"How can we take our land back if we can't even take you..."
"Respect!"
"Maybe the general could beat you."
"You serve your family well!"
"I was not focused, or else you would not have won."
"You have great talents! Respect."
"If only we had more like you among us."
"Another poor little one here to challenge the Heroes. Ha. Careful not to get bruised too bad!"

"Patrol time. Let's go!"
"All normal."
"Ok!"
"It was General Brazen that took back River Town. Today it is we who will guard it with our lives."
"Yes, Sir."
"How come the Beggars are so bossy in here?"
"These are not just any Beggars. They are all from the Beggar Sect, the biggest school in the realm. You'd be wise to not mess with them."
"How I love River Town's salted pork."
"Really? I wouldn't trade one bowl of black widow's noodles for ten carts of those."
"How General Brazen beat the Jurchens. But the king would be so biased to call him back. He was so scared of the general's power and talent that he had him killed. Now no one can save the realm against the offenders."
"What shame."
"If General Brazen were alive, the Jurchens wouldn't dare come near us. Now we've only got a bunch of sissies."
"Hush. They will hear you."
"We need to scrutinize all travelers passing through, in case any invaders get in. Please cooperate. "
"Hey, you! What are you doing there! Go! Don't block the road!"
"This hairpin's material is not that great. But the handwork is most delicate. It must cost a lot. "
"Ha. You stop it. "
"Your husband is such a sweet heart. He will buy anything to make you happy."
"I don't think you are anything special!"
"This is your best? Golly! Tuck your tails in and go home please. "
"You nasty beggar! Mind what you say! See if I don't break your legs!"
"That mouth can talk! See if you can fight!"
"A man must be humane. "
"A man must have integrity. "
"A man can always learn something from another. "
"Send him away! We have customers here. "
"Go away. We don't have time to deal with you. "
"Go away! We don't do charity!"
"I am not doing this just for me. I am helping you. "
"That Kenley has no heart!"
"Hush...He has quite a temper. Let it go. He didn't hurt the monk after all. "
"You realize you are staring at yourself, right?"
"Kick him."
"You kicked me!"
"Yeah, I did."
"See how I get you!"
"Come on then."
"These tusks can crush anything."
"These tusks can crush anything. You don't believe me? Come try me with one of your <font color='#00FF00'>Temperers</font>!"
"Give him a <font color='#00FF00'>Temperer </font>. (See what happens.)"
"Tusker crushed the Temperer."
"Some say my meat is not good. But no one says my knife is dull!"
"You, want more?"
"Guess what I have here in my basket?"
"One step closer, and I will shout! "
"You mess with me. I bring hell to you! "
"What? Calm down!"
"I hit you once. You stay still. And then I hit you again. This is how it's going to work! "
"No, that is not what I said!"
"I told you I don't want to! Well, suit yourself then! "
"Cut it out already! Look at me!"
"Steel is hard and cool. But the forge is bending and hot.  "
"Beating people is boring. I am going to go back and beat steel. "
"Geography, Astrology, Philosophy, Literature... I know everything. Let's discuss!"
"I said discuss, not fight! "
"I am but a lady! Go easy, will you?"
"Wait, don't hurt my beautiful hands!"
"I've been in too many fights and seen too much death to care. "
"Wait! I will give you a gift and let's call it a tie, ok?"
"Seize the moment!  "
"Now you've got me interested! "
"These hands are not merciful! "
"I fight till the end!"
"Ha, a fresh corpse it is!"
"Wait... What's happening here!"
"The starters are always so feisty!"
"An exercise is an exercise. Nothing more.  "
"No, kiddo, you messed with the wrong girl! "
"Well, I went easy on you, seeing as you are so little!"
"Master said fighting is wrong. I will only play three hands with you. And that's it!"
"Stop! Stop! We've passed three!"
"My sword dances. See if it dazes you!"
"Perhaps it doesn't dance that well yet. "
"Want to hear a little tune?"
"This is a lonely world..."
"Everyone is blessed with the Buddha's mercy. So are you.  "
"Amen. Amen. Amen. "
"Fine! It might be a good stretch. "
"Haha, what a fight! Let's do it again! "
"I have a soft heart.  "
"But soft heart can be scarier than a cold one!  "
"I am the sword. The sword is me. "
"We are one. "
"Yin-yang and elements. The mystery of the world. "
"I guess I am getting old then.  "
"Vian here. Pleasure to meet you. "
"Guanyin's mercy! "
"So where do you want me to hit you?"
"I will remember this! "
"Grab what you have, here and now. "
"Wait! I need to do my hair..."
"Sure! I haven't fought anyone for a while! "
"No, you are not my enemy! "
"They say I am too crazy. I say they are too dumb.  "
"Bring me a new bottle! "
"We come and we go, never knowing our purpose. "
"Time flies by and in the blink of an eye you are a pile of old bones."

[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Everything about what? Sal, Warren, what 's going on?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Warren: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, the Hidden Village exists to guard a secret. The Southern Lords lost their lives for this secret. Before General Brazen was executed, he sent four of his best warriors to take the volume he wrote in prison along with a letter to his brother...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Warren: </font>But the corrupt minister found out and sent troops to hunt down the messengers. The volume was torn in half during the struggle. The four warriors took the half they had and the letter and retreated to your house for shelter.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Warren: </font>Your grandfather suggested making a fake copy of the volume and of the letter. The four took the fake volume and real letter to the general's brother and your family kept the real volume for safekeeping.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Warren: </font>When the king redressed the general's case, the four tried to rally the troops for the general's brother. They snuck into the court to steal the minister's half of the volume. But it wasn't there. By the time they returned to retrieve the half your family kept it was too late...]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>And those four warriors were my four masters...right? I never knew the real reason behind my family's massacre. So that means the other four families were all slaughtered because of us...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Mason: </font>Time really flies. Now you have to leave our care. Do you know why all this time we've never taught you skills, but morals instead?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No. Please tell me, master.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Mason: </font>You carry a blood debt on your shoulders. We do not wish you to forget it, but we do not wish you let it fill your heart either. We hope you will be as your father was, just and merciful.]]

[[Rumor has it the unsolvable <font color='#00ff00'>Gambit</font> has resurfaced with <font color='#00ff00'>new twists</font>. The Gambit Frantic laid it out. Many have failed their attempts to solve it.]]
[[I don't have much else other than books. How about you pick some of these <font color='#00ff00'>Skill Books</font> as my gift to you?]]
[[Good. I heard <font color='#00ff00'>the Jurchen soldiers' passes have </font>some inscription on the back. <font color='#00ff00'>Collect 10 </font>and we can piece together the whole inscription. It's said to be a morale booster.]]
[[Here is a <font color='#00ff00'>Lotus Blossom</font> book. Practice it can <font color='#00ff00'>increase your MAX HP</font>.]]
[[Each captain manages dozens of soldiers. Take out some <font color='#00ff00'>Jurchen Captain</font>s and see if they don't panic.  ]]
[[Excellent. This <font color='#00ff00'>Tianyuan Spiral</font> can <font color='#00ff00'>increase your MAX MP</font>. It would be of help to you.]]
[[Floret Island in the east is Eastern Heretic, Theron's property. The monkeys there have a cluster of gold fur right below their necks. Can you <font color='#00ff00'>collect 5</font> clusters for me?]]
[[<font color='#00ff00'>Gold fur below the monkeys' necks</font>. Got it.]]
[[Nice. Just what I need. Here is a <font color='#00ff00'>Wisdom</font> skill book. Mind you, this skill has 13 layers.]]
[[I've thought about that. This is only my edited version. You will be able to practice with it fine. But I am afraid you can only use it to <font color='#00ff00'>increase defense</font>.]]
[[I would never try to hurt you! These Scorpions' tails are great medical ingredients. I would really love to behold them myself. Once you get the acupuncture, the scorpions won't be able to harm you. Please <font color='#00ff00'>catch 10 Scorpion</font>s for me!]]
[[Thank you. Here, the famous <font color='#00ff00'>Darkness </font>skill.]]

[[This time, can you get some <font color='#00ff00'>Venom Sucker</font> from Resonance Cliff? I have big plans for it.]]
[[It's not so powerful as rumored. But it can <font color='#00ff00'>increase dexterity</font>. Might as well give it a try.]]
[[This is the <font color='#00ff00'>last skill book I want to give to you</font>. It's one of the heathens' skills. But I found ways to improve on it.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Minna: </font>If I say it's okay, it's okay. This elephant is from Dali. Very strong legs. He is big, but trust me he is fast. I say he is perfect for you.]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Minna: </font>If I say  it's okay, it's okay. You and I, we are tough girls, like the Firebolt. Trust me, this one is perfect for you.]]

[[No need to be so courteous. <font color='#00ff00'>Mounts of higher stage have higher stats and add more stats to you</font>. Upgrade your mount and you will see.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ezra: </font>The four masters brought half of the volume and the letter to your family. The other half was taken by the minister. He copied passages from other books and forged a fake volume for the king. The king did not want to apply it in battle, but rather kept it hidden and sued for peace.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ezra: </font>Years later, this copy fell into Koen and Ramona's hands. No one dared move against them. So everyone turned to your family's half of the volume.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ezra: </font>The Occult Chief, Logan was determined to restore Jurchen's glory. To do this he needed General Brazen's volume. He planned the southern massacre for it, but came up empty. The massacre alerted the entire realm, so they laid low waiting for an opportunity to attain the volume.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ezra: </font>Carla, or [Dia] ,infiltrated The Inn at that time. She didn't learn the whereabouts of the volume here, but she found out about you. So Logan sent [Pawn], aka Aricia to your side as a spy.]]
[[Thank you for coming...But there has been some flood, and the cargo is delayed. It will arrive in River Town on <font color='#00FF00'>23rd, October</font>. Escorts will open then. Please wait. ]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>General Wade: </font>I've read the letter. I will keep an eye out. Thank you.]]
[[There is one way though. <font color='#00ff00'>To burn the bodies on site. </font>But...these soldiers sacrificed their lives for the realm...and this just seems too heartless...]]
[[We still need to examine the water and see if it's already been polluted. Here is a tube, please <font color='#00ff00'>collect a water sample from the river</font> for me.]]

[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Thank you, Brian.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brian: </font>This is General Wade's tent. He is occupied at the moment. Maybe you can meet him later.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brian: </font>This is the medic's tent. Our doc is a woman, but she is about the most brilliant doctor in the realm. You can always come to her if you need any medical assistance.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brian: </font>This is our Forge. Gorden has quite a mouth, but he does good work. You can always come here if you need any work done.]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Jurchen Watchman: </font>Who's there? It's the Song! We're under attack!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I can't let him alert the others!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tiger: </font>Haha. I got you! Where do you think you are going?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tiger: </font>Trying to escape my prison? No!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No, they found us!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hagan: </font>The Song army must be so scared of us, haha! Be at your best, people. I won't let anyone steal our conquest and glory.]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hagan: </font>Haha. That's right. Honestly, no one here is my match!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>A Song working for the Jurchens! How disgusting. Let's see if you're as strong as they say.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hagan: </font>Who's there!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hagan: </font>Ha! Came to die, did you? More than happy to oblige. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tulemu: </font>I am so sick of this. The brothers fighting the Jurchens got gold and women. And we are stuck here with nothing.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hezagu: </font>What do you know? They might die tomorrow. We are safe here. Nothing is more important than our own lives, young man.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tulemu: </font>What a coward.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hezagu: </font>Don't you assume what we're doing isn't important! The Jurchens will be finished soon. Then, we will take out the Song people. We are here to spy for the lord!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tulemu: </font>If you say so...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hezagu: </font>I will give you fifty gold if I'm lying. The lord needs to know the layout and the people here. And we are his eyes and ears.]]

[[Heavily guarded. <br/>I will have to fight my way to the tent.]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Randall: </font>That is not necessary! ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Who are you?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Randall: </font>Your savior! Come on! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Aricia: </font>Arson? Where were the guards?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Damien: </font>Those Song are so sneaky! We don't have enough guards to keep them out. But they've left tracks. They won't get far. I've already sent men after them.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Aricia: </font>You idiot! Of course the tracks are fake! The arsonists are still in the camp! You were tricked!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Damien: </font>In the camp? Let me catch him and skin him alive for you, princess!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Aricia: </font>No need. I am leaving immediately. Follow my plan! Damien, don't you dare defy me. The Occult won't allow it. And we are the only thing keeping the country from falling.]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Wes: </font>What other identity?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Damien: </font>No more questions! Get out! ]]

[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Perfect, it's him. I will catch him and ask about Aricia.  ]]

[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I know. But I must avenge my family and the other southern lords. I must uncover the truth.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Blind Master: </font>I tried to investigate it myself. But Theron blinded me soon after, before I could find anything concrete. There was one clue though...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Blind Master: </font>I went to the ruins of your old house. In the cellar I found a worm carcass. I am sure it's one of the Creed of Five's worms.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Koen: </font>I was friends with your father. He was a good man. He once shared a secret with me. It was the Volume of War that helped me through battles...]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Koen: </font>Yes. Ramona and I found a copy. We thought it was a complete copy. But your father told me it was only the half the minister took. The minister lied to the king about retrieving the entire volume. That somehow kept the other half safe...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Koen: </font>This is what I wanted to see you about. Your family was safe guarding the other half, right? It's a shame I couldn't find out who murdered the Southern Lords. If not for August, I wouldn't even have known about you...%s, do you know who the volume was really meant to belong to?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>General Brazen's brother. But the Volume is not complete...]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Koen: </font>Aricia, my master is too old to be treated like this. You should be ashamed of yourself. And the Volume is not mine to give!]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramon: </font>She is the princess. I am her guard. This half of the volume helped Koen win many unwinnable battles. Why wouldn't we want it?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No. You are equals. I can tell. You use code names...You, you were with the outsiders at Hidden Village! You said the Creed of Five planned the massacre. Is that true?]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adora: </font>Kerr. How cute. You set Karsten free. Going against my direct orders. What do you think the chief will say?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kerr: </font>Toad Consul, when did you get here?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adora: </font>Haha. That doesn't matter. What matters is I was on time for this touching show.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Karsten: </font>Traitor! Murderer, your own sister, disgrace!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adora: </font>Where was your sense of justice when Ana broke Bourne and I apart? When Bourne was poisoned by a toad I begged Ana, my sister, to save him.  She didn't. Some sister. I only killed her to avenge my lover!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Karsten: </font>Let go, Kerr! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adora: </font>He came here knowing he would die. I am only doing what's expected.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Karsten: </font>Kerr! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adora: </font>Oh, Karsten, how slow you are now...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Mysterious Girl: </font>You, Song fellow, do you know those who work for the Inn?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>A few. You are? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Mysterious Girl: </font>The Creed of Five took them. If you want to find them go to the Creed of Five's secret prison under the altar. Remember.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Simon: </font>Kerr is here. Set the feast. How is the prisoner, by the way? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tian: </font>Don't worry, he won't get away. Maybe we should give him a lashing?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Simon: </font>Don't be silly! He still has followers. Plus, Kerr will not approve of any mistreatment.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tian: </font>What a shame. I heard Guardian Kerr is favored for the position of Snake Consul?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Simon: </font>Yes. The chief favors Kerr the most. He even taught him the new heart worm trick. That monk will never be able to beat this plague. Then Kerr can come and save the day.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I will not let that happen!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tian: </font>The Five have come!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Yang: </font>I only just cleared this place out this morning. Not again! Are you hurt? ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I am fine. The carriers can't hurt me. You are from the Creed? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tian: </font>Yes. What are you doing here in Dali? Better get out.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Why can't I be here? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Yang: </font>No matter. We are leaving now anyway.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kellye: </font>Eh, isn't that <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>? Come over here!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nell: </font>Kellye! The carriers surrounded the palace! They are trying to break in. Eh, <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>! ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Hi, Nell.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kellye: </font>We can't have the carriers and the guards fighting each other. Where is the council? Where has he gone this time?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nell: </font>Who knows. This happens every time! Probably in the loo again just when you need him.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Spirit Fox: </font>Ge Ding. Ge Ding.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nell: </font>It's out! Wait. Let me get it closer!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Spirit Fox: </font>Ge Ding. Ge Ding.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nell: </font>Now! Catch it! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kellye: </font>Who are you? Don't you know this is The Inn's territory! Don't even try our patience!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Chia: </font>Better not put up a fight, little one. I don't want to hurt a little girl.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kellye: </font>I will show you what a little girl can do!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Pari: </font>We do not fear the Inn. Sorry luck, little girl.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Chia: </font>Couldn't be more true.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Pari: </font>Ok. Send news to Dia. We are ready to take the next step.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Maid: </font>Consul...Should we not stop them? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Mysterious Girl: </font>These men are not to be messed with. We can't risk sabotaging our plan. Let's leave here.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Spirit Fox: </font>Ge Ding. Ge Ding.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Here it is! I will get you this time!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Creed Vassal A: </font>It was this one that killed master Seth! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Creed Vassal B: </font>Bring this one to the chief!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>The Creed of Five...So soon!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nell: </font>Ah! The creed! Ugh, I'd better go check on Kellye and the Council. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, good luck.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Really? But, hey, you haven't told me how to find the Curer yet!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>Toad Consul, it's time to stop! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adora: </font>Spider? Didn't you die in Song?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>The chief knew Banes was up to something and ordered me to fake my death to work against him covertly. Who would think you were the one that rebelled against her. You even killed Scorpion!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adora: </font>Ha, if you were still here, perhaps she would have lived, ha! My silly sister. You are eight years late. Let's finish the fight now!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adora: </font>I am still...not your equal...Spider...promise me...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>What is it?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adora: </font>Bourne and I...We have a daughter...But I never got to be with her...Go find her...Beth...Don't let her be alone...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>Ok. I promise.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adora: </font>Bourne...sister...I am coming...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>May The Five lead you to the land of bliss.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>You have a mother. Her name was Adora. She was the Creed of Five's Toad Consul. Your father's name was Bourne. He was a doctor.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Beth: </font>A touching story you got there. Where are they then? Why don't they come for me themselves?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>They are with The five now. They asked me to take care of you.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Beth: </font>Like I know who you are.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>I am Lorsa, the Creed of Five's Spider Consul, leader of my people. I can train you and teach you how to cure illness. You will be respected. And you will have a home with me. From now on, you are my daughter. You are no longer Beth. You can have a new life.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Beth: </font>A...home? I don't care about my name. I will go with you.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>How about Novia as your new name? A new beginning.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nomad: </font>Look, there they are.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nomad: </font>Those chests are our cargo.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>The tea...it's a trap! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Carla: </font>Brother, you traveled thousands of miles to come here. We owe you our hospitality.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>So the mole really is you! Carla, you've been with us for more than a dozen years. You are the Whisperer. Why, why would you betray us?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Carla: </font>I've been treated well, I admit it. But that does not mean that  I am obligated to be loyal because of it! I am Dia from the Occult of the great Jurchen. I used the position of Whisperer only to help me collect information.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>This is some kind of sick parody, isn't it? A mole among us working for Jurchen! Do you not know - Jurchen is gone?! Logan is dead. What are you doing all this for? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Carla: </font>That's not your concern. Now settle down. Give me <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> and go get some rest.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Following me all this way must be tiring, lady. Why not show yourself and we'll have a nice chat. Your master, Soren was not this sneaky in Dali.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sword Maid: </font>You know the master? Why didn't you say so then? ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I say what I wish to say.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sword Maid: </font>Say it to my sword then!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No, my token!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sword Maid: </font>This token...you are one of Tiger's men? ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(Tiger? This token from the Men in Black turned out to be useful after all.) You got me. Can I have my token back now?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sword Maid: </font>Of course. Follow me, please!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Lead on.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Salman: </font>Madam, the plan is going great. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> didn't doubt a thing and is going to the house.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Carla: </font>Good. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> has come in contact with Blood Thorn. Have Farcia add some Cobalt Grass to the exposed area.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Salman: </font>Yes, Madam.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Logan: </font>You speak of settling a blood debt. Who is to settle the debt owed to us then? ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>You stop that right now! You invaded us. You took our lands and hurt our people. You got what you deserve.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Farcia: </font>Hahaha. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> You're a curious one, aren't you! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Logan: </font>You dare insult our soldiers!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, calm down. It will trigger your poison!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Farcia: </font>This one...yes.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Lie to me and I will make sure you die along with me! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Farcia: </font>I wouldn't dare.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Basim: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, you are surrounded. Release Farica and we can talk.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(No, the Mongols have caught up! I will try my luck then. You take the medicine and feel better instantly. It was the right one.) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>Wait! <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, careful! It's a trap!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Soren: </font>Scooper? Why bother coming back? You are lucky you got out the first time.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>I came back for you.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Scooper, how did you get in? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>I am the Inn Council. I get around. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, you can't fight him. Hear me out first.  ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Ok. Speak your mind.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>It's like an oven out here...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kellye: </font>Council, why didn't you get Whisperer's men to meet us with camels? Now we have to walk all this way...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>I asked you to stay in River Town. You wanted to come yourself. Come, hurry up. We need to catch up with <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kellye: </font>Ok, OK!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Davelin: </font>Helping the heathens hurt our brothers! Who are you?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I am no one important. What are your names?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Davelin: </font>Cut it out! Too late to be nice now. I will teach this little nobody the difference between right and wrong.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Damek: </font>Priestess!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Wait! Not now. You won't save her going there now.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Damek: </font>The Priestess is holy! No harm shall come to her! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Salman: </font>Madam, the lizards are too vicious. Many of us have been killed by them. We really have done our best here...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Crest Apprentice: </font>Useless old fools! What do we keep you for then, if not for these lizard skins! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Salman: </font>Please! We did our best! Please, give us one more month! We will have enough then! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Crest Apprentice: </font>A month? Too long. I will give you 10 days! Lizard skins or your heads. You choose.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Basim: </font>No one appreciates a good warrior like a Mongol. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, you did a great job slaying Logan! Cheers!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I slew Logan to avenge my family and keep him from plotting against my country. What's that got to do with you? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Basim: </font>Ha. You are so humble. Come, drink this and let's be friends.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Sorry, but I don't make friends with Mongols.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Basim: </font>Oh, come on, even Koen used to be our prince-to-be. It's just a drink, no biggie. What can a little drink do to you? ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Whatever. One drink.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Basim: </font>Good! I will cut to the chase.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Let's hear it out then.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Basim: </font>Your king is weak. However Koen and the others try, your country is going down. We are coming for you. Why not join the winning side and make something of yourself?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>So you want me to betray my own country.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Basim: </font>Well, that's just one biased way to see it.  ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>That's the only way I see it.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Basim: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, your attitude is really getting to me. I am trying to be nice here.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I do not care for civility.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Farcia: </font>Oh, Scooper, our hero returning to save the realm.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Fake Soren: </font>Farcia? What are you doing here? Go back to your business! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Farcia: </font>Oh, I am so scared, master. But the House doesn't need me anymore. Oh, right. I forgot to tell you, it doesn't need you anymore either.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Fake Soren: </font>Whatever do you mean?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Farcia: </font>Oh, sorry, I forgot to tell you. The Mongols admire your fame so they asked to take the house under their wing. And I said yes.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Fake Soren: </font>You! You sold yourself to the Mongols!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(What an eventful day today...) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Elysia: </font>The Lotus Creed has never crossed you Western Monks. Why is it that you want to harm us?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Davelin: </font>Every just warrior should slay heathens! We don't need to follow rules when it comes to you!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Elysia: </font>Lotus Fire, burning essence of the living. Lotus Fire, shine glory on us. Lotus Fire, pity us.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Oakes: </font>I will burn you today!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(The troubles of the world never cease.) What's going on here?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Carla: </font>No need. I won't hide. You'll deal with me right now.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>Carla, you joined The Inn 17 years ago. From your time as Listener to Hearer, to Whisperer, Ezra has shown you nothing but love. He deserves to know why you would betray him.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Carla: </font>The Occult gave me a home when everyone else abandoned me. I will serve it and Logan alone.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Carla: </font>I've lost. The cause is lost. Now I can only take my life to honor them.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>Stop! Ezra will decide what fate shall be bestowed on you.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Carla: </font>Ha. I knew it wouldn't be this easy. I lost my heart long ago anyway. Do whatever you wish to me. I am an empty shell.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, it is too damp here. Let's get out.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Sure.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Scooper: </font>Too late...]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>These men are not to be feared. You are wounded. Stay here with Kellye. I will handle them.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kellye: </font>No. It's too dangerous for you to fight them alone!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I will be fine. Don't worry.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>Adrial! (Looking at Adrial with a loving look) I searched everywhere for her...And here she is...]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(This is his master, Adrial? ) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>Adrial!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adrial: </font>Albelt...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>I've searched the realm for you!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Gold Kanet: </font>How lovely. Let me help you celebrate! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adrial: </font>Ah!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adrial: </font>Albelt, wait...Where is that Payton? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Payton: </font>Adrial! Payton is...here!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adrial: </font>Albelt, I am no longer pure. This man...I am no longer deserving of your love...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>Adrial, don't you know how much I love you? Whatever has happened, I still want you to be my wife. As for this man...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Payton: </font>Adrial! I know I've committed a grave sin. I feel too ashamed to even face you. Let me die for my sins!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>Today, in the presence of Cyrus, our Master, Albelt and Adrial shall be wed. From this day on, we shall never leave each other's side. We shall always cherish and love each other.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adrial: </font>Master Cyrus, please protect this union. Let us be husband and wife for all eternity.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Newly weds, honor the heaven and earth.  (How lucky they are to have found each other despite everything.) ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Honor your elders. (Master Cyrus and Athena were never able to marry. They live the life they wished for through their pupils.) ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Honor each other.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(I, <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, came into this world seeking vengeance. I killed my dearest friend and perversely became famous for it. I do this by myself, but I am by no means alone.) ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Congratulations.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Logon: </font>Albelt! You were one of our pupils. How can you hold your old master hostage and dishonor Master Cyrus so! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>Looks like we won't have time for a wedding reception.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Logon has come. Albelt, I will stall him. You take Adrial home.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>Thank you! I owe you a feast. Come to the tomb afterwards and we will drink.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Frey: </font>Ah! Ah! Oh, that hurts! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>Frey, the Kid? ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>It must be him. This is perfect for us! Go, Albelt.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>These wasps are the Tomb School's wasps. Very poisonous. Take this Wasp Honey. They shouldn't harm you if they smell the scent of it on you. In case they do attempt to hurt you, just remember that they are afraid of fire.]]

[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Albelt, are you ok? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>(He turns to you and nods slightly. Obviously in the middle of helping Adrial open her chakras.) ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Adrial's chakra has been disturbed? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>(Nodding slightly.) ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Let me help. I will give some of my vita!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> is right. What's important is we love each other. No matter what others might think.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Adrial: </font>Albelt...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Albelt: </font>Adrial, let's get married in front of Master Cyrus today. Let the world know we can be together.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Landry: </font>Who's there?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I was passing by and heard the Taoist School was in trouble. I came to help.]]

[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Investiture? But the pupils downhill said the Mongols had come to cause trouble for you?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Landry: </font>They are here to give my master official honors. No trouble. Now, would you please leave?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>The Taoist School and the Mongols! Whatever next. I must see this.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Landry: </font>You dare insult us! The Master will hear of this!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Good kid.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lilas: </font>I led you in as promised. You may be a friend to Adrial but I am most definitely not.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Stop!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rihane: </font>Did you hear that too?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rihane: </font>Lilas! And...<font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Cal: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, please. Now is not the time. Let's think about how to get out first.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rihane: </font>I said I didn't mean it! What else do you want me to say! I wouldn't have done it if he hadn't crossed me first!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>What a...!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Connan: </font>Rihane, enough! <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, please. If Lilas could get out, there must be a way out. Let's find it.]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Taoist Pupil: </font>Help...Help!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Someone is calling for help...Stay here. Let me go check.]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Pasi: </font>The heathens! What are they doing here?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I wonder whether Rance and Elysia are with them.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Shan: </font>The chief is working double time to sort this out. Meanwhile, Pasi here is making trouble. Someone came with a fake invitation...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Mundus: </font>After the free food?]]

[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lotus Disciple: </font>A little Beggar! Catch him!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lotus Disciple: </font>Elder, Kane wishes to see the Beggar.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>I will go.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(Looks like Regan doesn't like Kane very much.) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>That's fast. Disciples, make some room for our guests.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>Ramona, what a pleasure.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>I am here to resolve this misunderstanding. I am sure you already are in full possession of the facts surrounding the Lotus Sigil. So, please enlighten me as to the purpose of this play.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>I also request you return the Dog Cane.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>I invited you here for two reasons. First to strategize with you in our shared struggle against the Mongols. Second, to introduce you to a guest.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>You have the Dog Cane. I don't have much of a choice, do I? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>Haha, please. This way.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sonta: </font>What are these? Quite fearsome!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No, we didn't get them all! That man is still in danger!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>What do you want to see this Beggar for?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kane: </font>I just want to ask him a few questions.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Who are you? You know me?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kane: </font>I am Kane, a traveler like you. I wish to know the Old Beggar's whereabouts.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>The master only turns up when he sees fit. I have no idea where he is now.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kane: </font>My family has ties with the Beggar Sect. I am in a bind. I wish to speak to the Old Beggar about it...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>Kane, I'm still here. Long has the Lotus Creed sheltered you...You would dishonor us in this way?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kane: </font>Regan...You know my situation. Sia...Please help me take care of her.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>You don't need to worry about Sia!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kane: </font>My grandparents met in a dream. Grandmother searched high and low in Tangut for Grandfather. The chances of them actually meeting were virtually nothing. But she found him...]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>That's pretty amazing. You said your family has ties with the Beggar Sect. So your grandfather was a Beggar? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kane: </font>No. My grandfather was a monk who once met a great master that taught him many things...Anyways, he was a sworn brother of the Chief Beggar.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Was your grandfather the Tangut prince, Trawet?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Big Foot: </font>Thank you all for coming to our event! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nameless Hero: </font>A pleasure, Chief Big Foot. Ramona must be enjoying her retirement very much!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Big Foot: </font>Haha. No, no. Chief Ramona is still a pillar of the Beggar School.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>[He looks like a sturdy guy.] ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Gold Kanet: </font>To live under a woman's thumb for this long. I pity you, Chief Big Foot.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Big Foot: </font>Gold Kanet? Long time no see. Here in Song again, I see.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Gold Kanet: </font>Of course I would come to congratulate you!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(Gold Kanet? He can't be up to any good here. ) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Pasi: </font>Chief! Chief! We have a spy here! ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(No, he woke up already!) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Shan: </font>Chief! This is the one that had that fake invitation! Pasi was going to bring the trickster to you, but the bastard hit him over the head.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Big Foot: </font>What did they look like? Look and see if they're here.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Pasi: </font>Wait... (Looks around and sees you.) There! That one!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Gold Kanet: </font>The lord sent me to take over the Beggar Sect. Even though <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> beat Delsin today, we will still sail through this one. Come, let's celebrate.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Keene: </font>Delsin, defeated? Is <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> really that good? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>Haha. Good wine! I will say leave the Beggar Sect, and take <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>. You haven't forgotten Hermit Peaks, have you!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Gold Kanet: </font>You've nothing but vanity. We are here to take over the Beggar Sect and the Song warrior community.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Gold Kanet: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>? How did you get here? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Keene: </font>Looks like the guards outside are already dead.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>Good timing! I was going to catch you!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sonta: </font>Like you can.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>Who are you to insult me! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Gold Kanet: </font>Shut up! <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, since you are here. Let's fight it out.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I thought you'd never ask! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Gold Kanet: </font>Impressive! Your power has grown tremendously. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, you have a bright future ahead!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>You are a strong warrior. If not for the war, we might have been friends.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Gold Kanet: </font>What a pity. I lost. I swear never to set foot in Song as long as you, <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> are here.  ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Good! I hope you honor your words!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Zhao: </font>Chief Ramona! Chief Ramona, bad news! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>What is it?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Zhao: </font>Chief Big Foot! They chased Gold Kanet to Verdant Woods and he...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>He what?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Zhao: </font>He was badly wounded...The brothers carried him back. And...the Dog Cane is gone...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>No! Take me there! <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, come along.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No. I was bitten!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sia: </font>How did the Snow Spiders get here? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sia: </font>Someone is hurt. Crane, save this one.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Crane: </font>Tsk.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Red Crane...(Passed out.) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hanes: </font>Chief Big Foot was murdered and you sent an outsider to go investigate! I wonder why? Do you see us as unfit to investigate our own affairs?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Beggar: </font>I believe Chief Ramona has her reasons. Who are you to judge her decisions?  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hanes: </font>I am not judging. But do you see that person coming this way? How are we to find out who did it if they can not?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>Hanes, you look like you have something to say to me. Why not say it out in the open?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hanes: </font>Chief Ramona, no need to be flippant. We all know that this <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> is rumored to be the heir of the Southern Lords. But all five of the Southern Lords, and their families, were slaughtered years ago. How can we determine the truth of this rumor?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hanes: </font>Of course we would question why you trust an outsider more than us. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> came with a fake invitation and said it was from Rihane. I wonder what should be made of that.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Hanes! What secrets might there be!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Beggar: </font>Ah, I remember now. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> hit Pasi. Hanes has a point. Chief Ramona, we deserve an explanation.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>This is...Holden!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>Holden it is.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>So Gold Kanet only left to pave the road for Holden...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>I guess this plan is not working that well for them either. Let's search him and see if there is any clues about the whereabouts of the Dog Cane.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Good idea.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>This cane looks a bit off...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Strange Voice: </font>To have the Dog Cane home, what a cause to celebrate. Chief Ramona, I hope these happy moments last.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Who's there? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>Let's go and see.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>Heathens, how dare you!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(Lotus Creed usually keeps to itself. It's unlike them to come to such an event.) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ramona: </font>No! The Dog Cane! Give it back, heathen!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>When you give back our Lotus Sigil. I await you in Green Waves.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Mongol Patrolman: </font>Who's there?!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Poor you! Bad timing.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sonta: </font>Elder Regan, I am Sonta. I wish to join the Lotus Creed. Will you take me?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>Young man, you do know we have rules. Have you thought about it carefully?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sonta: </font>I have. And I have decided.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>There is solitude and absolution in the Lotus Fire. May it's light shine upon us.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>You need to be baptized in the Lotus Fire. Come with me and we will perform the ritual. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, please return the Dog Cane to Chief Ramona for me.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Ok. Until next time.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>Father, How have you been? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>...! Lorsa!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>Yes, I am still alive. I came back South. Father, I have nearly completed our vengeance. Only, Banes fled and I haven't found him yet. I thought I would never see you again.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Spider Consul! The Heart Worm...Was it you? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>Only the chief knows how to train Heart Worms. It's not me.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>What? You didn't become the new chief?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>No. The next in line for the seat is Novia. I will not deprive her of her birth right.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Spider Consul is a just person.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>I am no longer the Spider Consul. I inherited Father's Enforcer seat when it was clear he was not returning. Before Novia comes of age, I will guide her.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Banes: </font>Guru...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>No. He's turning! <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, move away! Ah!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>Lorsa! Banes! Don't you hurt my daughter!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kane: </font>Careful, Elder Regan! It is no longer human!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sia: </font>Kane! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kane: </font>Sia, what are you doing here?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Banes: </font>Guru...all of you will die...Guru.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Sia: </font>Kane, watch out! Ah!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kane: </font>Sia!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>Banes, die now!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Banes: </font>Lorsa...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Banes: </font>Messing with...me...You will die...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>You infected yourself with the Heart Worm. You don't have many days left.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Banes: </font>More than enough to kill you...and destroy Song...]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>This is it. This is the end of your road!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, no need to waste time with him. Crush what I just gave you.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Banes: </font>I will...bite you...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Regan: </font>Lorsa! <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>! These are Eater Worms! Banes used the Heart Worm.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kane: </font>These worms are ferocious! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Lorsa: </font>Father, be careful!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font>You are the heir of Southern Lords', <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>? ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>It is me, Master Tranquility.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font>Tranquility has a debt to settle.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>With me? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font>With you. (The door opens, and out steps Carla.) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font>Who dares disturb the temple!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>What's going on?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Keene: </font>What luck! This nun is too tough!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font>Leave now or I will slay you!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>Keene, let's go! ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No! Wait!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font>The Lanka Sutra...It should be fine then. I will be straight with you. Your family's half of the Volume of War is probably in the Sacred Monastery's Library.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>How are you so sure? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font>The clues I gathered back at The Inn prove it. But the monastery is too heavily guarded. And you seemed to be an easier lead. So I never followed that lead.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>You didn't report that to Logan, did you? Or else he would have gone there. But why?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font>I had my own agenda. If you don't believe me, you can ask Inn Council.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Good, I can still see their footprints in this snow. There is only one way up and down Mount Hua. They can't get away.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Little Girl's Voice: </font>Jiēdì, jiēdì, bōluó jiēdì, bōluósēng jiēdì, pútí suōpóhē]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Someone is reading the Heart Sutra. Maybe she saw them.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Waylayer: </font>You can't pass here. Find another way.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nell: </font>When did this road become private property? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Waylayer: </font>Go whine somewhere else, little girl.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>But why are you blocking the road?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Waylayer: </font>I don't need to explain to you! Go away. Come back tomorrow!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>But I want to go up today! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hua Disciple: </font>Heathens! Who have you tricked into helping you now?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>What heathens? Show some respect.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Raleigh: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, these are the warriors of the Mount Hua school.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Hua Disciple: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>? Why are you with the heathens? You shame your family.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>You shame common decency! Let us see how good Mount Hua is then.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Old Beggar and Western Venom were both grandmasters of this generation. Alas they would both end here...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>Keene, I figure we can hide on this mountain for a few days. Those monks won't find us here. Once they've left, we can head back west.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>…(Keene and Patton? I need to find out what they are after.) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Keene: </font>No. If they can't find us, they will guard the road downhill. We will surely fall into their hands there.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>True. What do you think we should do then? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Keene: </font>I think we should find a remote temple and set up camp in it. Those monks would never think we would stay for years here. They will eventually leave if we don't come down.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>Good idea.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(What monks are they talking about?) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>Friends that have borrowed books but never returned them. Please show yourselves.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>No! They found us. Come, hide! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Keene: </font>Yes, behind the tombstones! ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Sorry, already taken.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Keene: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Raleigh: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>! There is no where but hell you can go today!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Raleigh...What is this? (No! Snow Ape is gone!) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Raleigh: </font>I thought you were one of the good ones. Who would have thought you would murder the Ten Elders! ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Raleigh, calm down. I was a victim too.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Raleigh: </font>You, a victim? Do I see the Ten Elders here, alive and well?! Gold Fighters, take this scum down!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Snow Jaguar: </font>Roar!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>What is that?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Baird: </font>Snow Jaguar! ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Looks like we've become their prey.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Raleigh: </font>Snow Jaguars are very swift. Do be careful! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Baby Jag: </font>Aw! Aw!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>There is a cub. So they were trying to protect the cub.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Baird: </font>Snow Jaguars are extremely rare. We should not have done this.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>The cub is too young. Let's go take a look.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kegan: </font>Master, let's go check that platform.  ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Sometimes what you are looking for is right before you.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>Kegan, listen. Someone is trying to help us.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>All you need to do is to look closer.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>Thank you! Keene, Patton, please return the Lanka Sutra to me.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kegan: </font>Oi, redhair, give the sutra back!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>You don't talk like a good monk, little one.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kegan: </font>You are one to talk!  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>...Impressive, little one.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kegan: </font>Where did you hide the sutra!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>I told you we don't have it. We won't have it even if you beat us to death!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Snow Ape: </font>Aw! Aw!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Patton: </font>Only an animal will save us now.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Keene: </font>We are that down on our luck...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rai: </font>Taking Earth Fighter's weapons! How dare you! Fighters, on my mark...]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Please, we are not from Mount Hua. Where is Elysia, Rance, Elder Regan, or Sonta?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rai: </font>Stop! Wait...Who are you?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>I am <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>. And what's your name? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rai: </font>Liar! I have never had anything to do with Mount Hua, let alone Rain! He is the first apprentice there.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>But, Rai, how would you know so much about him if you don't have anything to do with him.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rai: </font>I...I heard of his name. How is that strange? ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rance: </font>Why did you put up a road block? There was never an order to seal the mountain.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rai: </font>I just wanted to keep the place quiet for the elders to fight! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rance: </font>Rai, are you panicking?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rai: </font>...This is it then! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rai: </font>Out of my way!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rance: </font>Do not let him get away!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rai: </font>Little girl, pardon me. I need to borrow your life.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nell: </font>You don't look like a bad man. So I will spare your life.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rai: </font>Spare me...? (Passed out.) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rance: </font>Nicely done! How did you subdue him?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Nell: </font>A messenger needs to know a few tricks. Rance, you've got the traitor. You can report back to the chief now. As for what happened here, The Inn knows the truth. We won't let them cover this up.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rance: </font>Good. Thank you Messenger. <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, I am afraid I have to get back to the Lotus Peak now.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Travel well, friend.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Rance: </font>Lotus Creed owes you one.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Thank you, Rance. Until next time.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Wind: </font>...! ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>What is that? Dynamite? Someone planted dynamite in the cave! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Wind: </font>Not possible! We sent the best of men here to guard this cave. Nobody could have got in.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Think about what you just said, dear Wind.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Wind: </font>No. No! No way!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Let's get out of here first. You take it in.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Strange Voice: </font>Aw!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Wind: </font>What is that? ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Sounds like apes...(Keene and Patton? ) Wind, the men I am looking for are there. Care to join me?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Snow Ape: </font>Aw! (The ape thanks you for saving it.) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Snow Ape: </font>Aw! (He turns away and digs in the dirt. Light is coming through.) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font><font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, wait. Take Nell with you. She is too young. It's not fair to have her spend her life like this here with me.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Wisdom: </font>No! I won't go! Have I done something wrong?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font>Nell, we talked about this. You promised me.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Wisdom: </font>But, I...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Tranquility: </font>Go, go with <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>. You can go back to The Inn or just travel the world as you like. This is not a life for you here.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Don't worry. I will take care of her. Come.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Water Monk: </font>Gone gone, gone beyond, gone altogether beyond, O what an awakening, all hail!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>Wow, your Effects and energy are great! I am not your match. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>When the floor is undone, I have no patience to play. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>Ok. I should be playing with <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>. But you got me. Come, let us see how your swordplay is. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>I know nothing about swordplay. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>Liar!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Wait, Master Clarion doesn't know any skills. He will get hurt!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>Master, why don't you rest some more? You've been through too much today. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>Let the energy follow...your mind...direct your mind...with your heart...]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>…(Could it be Sutra of Suns? But it is so different from what I've learned so far...) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>Who is there? You! Why did you have to chase us? Do you really have to capture these poor men!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Master Chastiser: </font>You've mistaken me. I am not a rule follower. Clarion, Master Nobody led the Dharma Monks east. You should head west!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kegan: </font>Master, wake up! Master Chastiser is here to help us...Master! Master!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Master Chastiser: </font>Amitabha…He has passed. May peace be with him. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>Hide! Hurry. Hide and wait for him to come. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>Ok! Now!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>Clarion! What are you doing?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>Wah! You scared me. What are you doing?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>Ha, you talked!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>Brooks of Kunlun Mount, here to deliver a message.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Abbot Serenity: </font>Forgive me for not receiving you more properly.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>It's all good. I am but an idle swordsman. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Abbot Serenity: </font>You are much too humble. Please come in. But this lady...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>Abbot, I came here to deliver a message. I will be gone right after. This temple would not allow a lady in. All these rules are most upsetting to me. I don't understand how you would treat men and women different. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>Brooks, it's fine. I don't need to go in. I am friends with Master Chastiser. I don't want you two to have any problems.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>Oh, ok then. Abbot, is there a Master Clarion here? I need to deliver the message to him.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Abbot Serenity: </font>...Clarion? Uh...(Abbot Serenity looks embarrassed. Obviously he's forgotten Clarion is in the Monastery.)]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Abbot, Brooks is talking about the master that looks after the Library. Wait, did he come looking for the Lanka Sutra?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Abbot Serenity: </font>Oh, him. Come, find Master Clarion for our visitor.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Arhat Monk: </font>The First Seat of Arhat Hall demands that you put down your weapons and state your business. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>Yikes, they sound just like local officers.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>You call this just? Bullying people?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Master Chastiser: </font>Stop! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Master Learning: </font>Who taught this one his skills?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Abbot Serenity:  </font>Clarion hasn't learned any skills. Who taught this one his?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Master Learning: </font>I am asking you! Who taught you the moves?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kegan: </font>I watched the Iron Arhats and learned from them. No one taught me. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Master Nobody: </font>Dharma disciples, take him down! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>Abbot...This is not his fault...Please...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Master Learning: </font>Arhat Disciples, take him down! And bring him to Order Hall for sentencing!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>What's going on? He beat Brooks. And these monks look like they want to eat him alive! This doesn't look good. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Arhat Disciple : </font>First Seat! The Abbot is calling for you on an urgent matter. (Moves near Master Chastiser and whispers.)]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Master Chastiser: </font>[Angry] What?...(Turns to you and Ria)<font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>, Ria, I am afraid I will have to excuse myself from you for now...]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No, it's ok. Please. We can wait. Right, Ria?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>I am only here to ask Master Chastiser whether you've seen or heard from Albelt. I've lost contact with him. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Master Chastiser: </font>Sigh...I was going to ask you the same. I've lost contact with him too... ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ria: </font>(Disappointed) Nobody knows where he is...Well, thank you, master. I should go back now. ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>So dark. Is this the Library? (You look around and notice someone watching you from the corner.) Who's there?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Deverell: </font>Young master, I have awaited your coming...]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>You are...?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Deverell: </font>Old Master asked my three brothers and I to stay here at the Monastery. You were not yet born then. Now look at you. I am so pleased to see you so grown up.]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>You are one of the guardians?...I...(You are so overwhelmed with emotions, you nearly cry out.)]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Deverell: </font>Amitabha…I am sorry you had to go through all of those tragedies, young master... ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Bishop: </font>Here you are, young master. ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Here I am. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Bishop: </font>What do you think of young master's power and skills, brothers?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Deverell, Ansel, and Bert: </font>Most excellent. Well beyond ours.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Bishop: </font>Good. Good. Now you must face me.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Bert: </font>Amitabha. Bishop, brothers, it's time for us to complete our last mission.]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Deverell: </font>Yes it is. If young master had come a few years later, we would have been merely useless old bones. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ansel : </font>Bishop, ready when you are. ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Wait, guardians...What are you doing?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Bishop: </font>Young Master, the four of us are too old to follow you now. But we still have energy that can help you. We wish to pass it on to you, to aid you as you follow your destiny. ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>What? No! It's your lifelong work! No!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Bert: </font>Young Master, our only lifelong work is to serve your family. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Bishop: </font>Everyone in place!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Bishop: </font>Master, focus!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No! Ah...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>Ouch! Stop it!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kegan: </font>Master, watch out!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>Only a child, and already so good! What a place! Come, little one. If you can beat me, I will never step foot in middle land again! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Master Chastiser: </font>You are too humble. The Kunlun Giant deserves a more worthy opponent. What about me?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>I will not stomach this insult!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Kegan: </font>Hey!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>Brooks, Brooks, lost to a child. I accept my inferiority gracefully! You are good!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Brooks: </font>Master Clarion, the message is: the sutra is in the oil.   ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Master Clarion, they won't listen to any plea. Take Kegan and run!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>No...Ah...What...]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No time! Go!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Clarion: </font>Thank you, <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Haha! <font color='#31cf32'>%s</font> , Today you'll have a taste of the Monastery's finest!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Demitri: </font>There! Stop! We don't want to hurt you! ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>What do you want?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Demitri: </font>We are looking for the Kunlun people. You know Brooks. You must know where they are. ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>You don't sound too polite for someone asking for a favor!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Demitri: </font>This is not a favor! I am demanding an answer!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>You!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Isam: </font>Hush!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Demitri: </font>It's the Kunlun people. They must be deep within the cave. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Isam: </font>Shall we capture them and get some intel? Then we can charge deeper into the cave . ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Demitri: </font>There are two of them coming this way. Perfect! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Isam: </font>Hold on...Wait till they come closer. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Demitri: </font>Ok. Now!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Isam: </font>Demitri, don't kill the warrior yet. The chief wants to meet this one.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Demitri: </font>Why!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Isam: </font>Because the chief said so. You two bring this one to the chief.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Soterios: </font>This is the oil?]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Yes. It's not actually oil. I assume that was a misunderstanding. If one can decipher this scripture, he can find a way to open a secret gate and find the sutra. Only, Master Clarion hadn't fully deciphered it before he passed.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Soterios: </font>Ha, isn't that convenient! Young one, you know I can't bring this wall to my tribe or stay here and study it either. Seems as if you will have to find me that apprentice of Clarion's to decipher it. ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>He just left the Monastery. I don't know where he is now. But I sure can start chasing him now. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Soterios: </font>Good idea! Only if I let you start chasing him, I might have to start chasing you...]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Demitri: </font>Chief, we found the Kunlun people. ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Soterios: </font>Where?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Demitri: </font>In the cave up ahead. They are after something. The cave is called Dharma Cave, it's where Dharma used to meditate. And there is a tank of light oil in the cave.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Soterios: </font>Light oil? Ha, young one, looks like you are out of luck. Follow me, let's go check out this tank.  ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Soterios: </font>Young one, give me the package. ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>Don't you need to let me out first?]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Soterios: </font>I will say it one more time. Give me the package!]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>No way! ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Soterios: </font>Well then. Isam, seal the tank.  ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s: </font>(How cunning and cruel! I will have to break this tank, or I will die here!) ]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ellis: </font>Haha, well done!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ellis: </font>You really thought I was that weak!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ellis: </font>Now you pay!]]
[[<font color='#278cf1'>Ellis: </font>%s</font>, give me the book.  ]]
[[<font color='#31cf32'>%s</font>: You faked it?]]
